			<h2 id="anatomical-approach">Anatomical Approach</h2>
			<h3 id="complications-of-advanced-sacral-decubitus-ulcers">Complications of advanced sacral decubitus ulcers</h3>
			<p>Sacral decubitus ulcers are classified as pressure skin and soft tissue injuries caused by unrelieved pressure that damages the underlying tissue on a bony prominence. Pressure injuries can range from superficial SSTI (Stage I) to injury with bone exposed (Stage IV). Ulcers are seen in patients with decreased mobility.</p>
			<p>All ulcers contain bacteria, but only some ulcers need management of bacterial infections.</p>
			<h4 id="clinical-symptoms">Clinical symptoms</h4>
			<p>Identification of infection, including drainage, redness, odor, erythema, warmth, fever, leukocytosis and delayed wound healing with tissue necrosis to help in diagnosis of sacral ulcer infection.</p>
			<h4 id="diagnosis-3">Diagnosis</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Deep tissue biopsy from a clean and debrided ulcer is gold standard.</p></li>
				<li><p>Be aware of difference between bacterial infection vs colonization of the ulcer as most ulcers are colonized with microorganisms.</p></li>
				<li><p>Needle aspiration of tissue below ulcer surface.</p></li>
				<li><p>Avoid superficial swab cultures (colonization more likely than infection).</p></li>
				<li><p>Blood cultures to evaluate for systemic infection caused by ulcer.</p></li>
				<li><p>Imaging not necessary unless for systemic infections or osteomyelitis concerns.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="pathogensbacteria">Pathogens/Bacteria</h4>
			<p>Patients with sacral ulcers have a risk factor to have indigenous skin flora infect the wound as well as the GI/GU tract as it has proximity to the wound. Common organisms include MRSA, VRE, gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter spp) from the GI/GU tract and anaerobes.</p>
			<p>Almost all pressure ulcers are colonized with polymicrobial pathogens, and ulcers may have resistance to organisms caused by biofilm producing-organisms. Complications of sacral decubitus ulcers arise when the sacral wound reaches the bone (stage IV) causing osteomyelitis as well as fistulas and sinus tracts to the bowel and bladder.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Osteomyelitis associated with pressure ulcer.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Not always treated with systemic antibiotics.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="management">Management</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Prevention is the best management. Extrinsic factors such as, reposition patients who are unable to do so themselves, decrease pressure on sacral area, decrease moisture to area and decrease shearing/friction to area</p></li>
				<li><p>Local wound care, wound care consult</p></li>
				<li><p>Debridement of necrotic tissue and biopsy of healthy remaining tissue prior to antibiotics starting</p></li>
				<li><p>Empiric therapy and de-escalate to Pathogen-directed therapy</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Most patients have sacral ulcers related to facilities (hospital, nursing home) where MDR organisms are more likely</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>MRSA, acinotobacter, pseudomonas, ESBL Klebsiella and E. coli</p></li>
					</ul>
					<li><p>Vancomycin/Daptomycin and</p></li>
					<li><p>Pip/tazo or Meropenem (1 gram Q8 hrs) or Ceftazidime (2g Q8 hours) PLUS Metronidazole (500mg Q8h hrs)</p></li>
					<li><p>Consider oral therapy once systemic infection has cleared or improvement of clinical symptoms</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Trim/Sulfa 2 DS Q12 plus amox/clav (875/125) OR</p></li>
						<li><p>Clindamycin (300-450 Q6-8hours) plus Cipro (500 Q12) or levofloxacin (500-750 Q24) or Moxifloxacin (400mg Q24hrs)</p></li>
					</ul>
					<li><p>Consider empirc coverage for a recurrent ulcer targeting previously identified organism.</p></li>
				</ul>
				<li><p>Plastics consult for skin graft/flap and debridement for sacral wound management</p></li>
				<li><p>It is important to remember that antimicrobials work in conjunction with local wound care, control of extrinsic factors, Plastic surgery plans for wound. Without all these factors working together, the sacral ulcer will have less of a chance of healing</p></li>
				<li><p>Duration of therapy is dependent on different factors (plastic surgery plan) but typically 5–10 days if systemic infection or osteomyelitis are ruled out</p></li>

						* Duration of antibiotic therapy depends on clinical response, area affected, and associated bloodstream infection, and is typically 5 to 14 days. Improvement is expected within 48 hours; if the patient is not clinically improved after this time frame, re-evaluate whether the antibiotic regimen is still appropriate and whether additional debridement is warranted.<br>
						&para; This may include additional debridement, antiseptic-impregnated dressing, an adjunctive treatment, such as negative pressure therapy. Refer to other UpToDate content on wound and pressure ulcer management.<br>
						&Delta; Bone biopsy may not be feasible in all patients; if not, treat for presumed osteomyelitis with prolonged empiric systemic antibiotics.<br>
						&loz; In patients who are not clinically ill, it is reasonable to hold antibiotic therapy until results of bone biopsy can guide antibiotic selection.
