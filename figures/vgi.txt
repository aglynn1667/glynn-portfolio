\subsubsection{Extracavitary VGIs: Recommendations for Management: Antimicrobial Therapy}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For patients with Samson class I or II VGI, a trial of antimicrobial therapy with or without surgical d\'{e}bridement for 2 or 4 weeks is reasonable (\emph{Class IIa; Level of Evidence B}).
\item For Samson class III or IV VGI, postoperative antimicrobial therapy for 4 to 6 weeks is reasonable (\emph{Class IIa; Level of Evidence B}). After the initial therapy, a course of oral antimicrobial therapy for 6 weeks to 6 months may be considered (\emph{Class IIb; Level of Evidence B}).
\item For Samson class V VGI, postoperative antimicrobial therapy for 4 to 6 weeks administered parenterally followed by at least 6 months of therapy administered orally may be considered (\emph{Class IIb; Level of Evidence B}).
\item For Samson class III, IV, or V VGI, long-term suppressive antimicrobial therapy may be considered for infection caused by MRSA, Pseudomonas,  multidrug-resistant microorganisms, Candida, or other fungal species; for those patients who have undergone emergency or multiple surgeries; for patients with graft preservation or in situ reconstruction with extensive perigraft infection; or for patients who are poor candidates for reoperation (\emph{Class IIb; Level of Evidence B}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Extracavitary VGIs: Recommendations for Management: Surgical Therapy}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For Samson class III infection, which occurs early ($<$2 months postoperatively), it is reasonable to consider graft preservation rather than graft excision and reconstruction (\emph{Class IIa; Level of Evidence B}).
\item For Samson class III infection, which occurs after 2 months postoperatively, graft excision and reconstruction may be considered instead of graft preservation (\emph{Class IIb; Level of Evidence B}).
\item For Samson class III or lV infection caused by MRSA, Pseudomonas, or multidrug-resistant microorganisms, or for patients for whom graft preservation or in situ reconstruction has failed, it is reasonable to perform extra-anatomic revascularization followed by graft excision instead of graft preservation or in situ reconstruction (\emph{Class IIa; Level of Evidence B}).
\item For Samson class V VGI, extra-anatomic revascularization followed by graft excision is reasonable (\emph{Class IIa; Level of Evidence B}).
\item For Samson class III, IV, or V VGI, ultrasound examination every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, followed by lifelong ultrasound examination every 6 to 12 months, is reasonable (\emph{Class IIa; Level of Evidence B}).
\end{enumerate}
