            <p>The English pines, as blown by Russian winds,
                <br>It&rsquo;s said, once swam the Atlantic Sea to plunge
                <br>Into the Caribbean seas and plunder;
                <br>For Hornigold who captured Concord mighty
                <br>Turned over peaceful Concord to his mate,
                <br>And Edward took the ship and made it strong,
                <br>With forty mighty cannons cased beneath,
                <br>And lighted fuses always burning bright
                <br>About his face, with shaggy barb&rsquo;rous beard,
                <br>They called him Blackbeard, ever feared by all,
                <br>And whom he knocked aside and left astray,
                <br>Some noble Stede would carry then ashore
                <br>His flotsam jetsam rag-tag fragment prey
                <br>Would cower &lsquo;fore the great Queen Anne&rsquo;s Revenge.
                <br>Yet ne&rsquo;er he laid a hand upon them, any,
                <br>But trusting to his raging, fearsome face,
                <br>He ne&rsquo;er began the fighting, went to Charleston:
                <br>He ransomed ev&rsquo;ry rag-bone safe and sound.
                <br>He ran the pines aground in Carolina
                <br>On Beaufort sandbar, waves resounding &lsquo;round.
                <br>He joined the seas again and broke the waters
                <br>Breaking the breakers, brushing off the rush
                <br>Of flowing sea, the salt encrusting ash
                <br>And pine and oak, and strength knew bindings none
                <br>Nor fetters: slaves within. And slave without
                <br>To only Blackbeard&rsquo;s will. Then Maynard came
                <br>Out from the fog: far off, through flaxen strands
                <br>His keen eyes sought the pirate king, the fisher
                <br>King who had reapt the oceans. Fight ensued
                <br>In clatt&rsquo;ring battle, grim and grisly, blood
                <br>And grime. And death dealt blows of might. And shorn,
                <br>Shorn from the roots, by cutlass sliced and sheared,
                <br>Blackbeard like wool dark fell, descended fast
                <br>And slammed his bulk down on the ashen deck.

                <br>Turned pirate&rsquo;s wife, then widowed from this post
                <br>Of high regard, and yet maintained, mainstayed,
                <br>Not wallowed in black waters, nay, but strove,
                <br>And thrived, Cheng&rsquo;s steel in hand, and yet erect.
                <br>A feat most proud, an undefeated fleet,
                <br>Blast-battered, barnacle-encrusted, yet,
                <br>Prolific warrior and sturdy foe,
                <br>And ever cunning, chose her triumph well:
                <br>Unarmed, invincible, she came. And still

                <br>Lived out her last in epic requiem.

                <br>With water clear, dilutes to cordial soil
                <br>As flaked or flayed from fair, white England&rsquo;s back,
                <br>Dissolute flows, ingrained, and broke to flux

                <br>Of breeze, its touch of kin, not brute, and light,
                <br>Lighter than blessings blow. So purity
                <br>Like lambs&rsquo; hair irritates, inflames. The rain
                <br>Washes away not that. The fallow maids,
                <br>The plough that soiled the virgin queen, and then,
                <br>The unicorn, with crooked horn, the foal
                <br>Or fool, and now, the clean rain runs, like men

                <br>Down on the working train, who dig and quake
                <br>For soil. Then comes, they hope, the final rain,
                <br>Rightful, torrential, pouring on the princes,
                <br>And with new-beaten ploughshares, honest men

                <br>He, England&rsquo;s swordsman lived and died and he,
                <br>The worthy martyr, slain by intrigue sly.
                <br>This English rain had washed the flesh in pain
                <br>Fresh rain had cleansed the clouded minds enmeshed
                <br>In popish wishes plain. The tyrant that

            <p>There an arthritic bullet lay, was stopped,
                <br>By bone, and blood encrusted wounds unchecked.
                <br>He stumbled, staggered back, was stamm&rsquo;ring, wrecked,
                <br>Lurched without want, as though by drink was hopped

        <div class="textbox">
            <p>In fields where rushes crushed beneath him, cropped
                <br>And ripe, but brown, produced a dead effect.
                <br>His room, with canvas, colours-clothed, bedecked,
                <br>From pots of inks and tinctures, stoppers popped.

        <div class="textbox">
            <p>The drunkard drained of dignity, and painted
                <br>Portent of peril, spiralled into madness
                <br>Flowering, blooming in his starry eyes.

        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Clutching colour, face and field, but tainted:
                <br>Strains of a plague, a harsh and harried sadness
                <br>Blossoming black, ingrained, and Vincent dies.
