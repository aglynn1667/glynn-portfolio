        <h1 class="section_title"><em>Drinking Vessels</em></h1>
        <h2>Chapter Four</h2>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Delphine had assumed that Bree would not have been working on the essay in anticipation of her meeting with Gavriel, or at least that her efficacy as a worker would be limited, and in a fit of rare realism insisted that her own was adequate as it was and that her time on the following day would be better spent helping Bree than fine-tuning. Bree recognized a bit of self-sacrificial behavior that might for once benefit her without burdening Delphine too much and jumped at the opportunity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>They spent the day in the library again, and to Bree&rsquo;s surprise, she managed to churn out almost an entire first draft. Whether the length and depth of the interrogation Delphine had given her the previous night had made her head whir and relive enough for one twenty-four-hour cycle, whether Delphine’s constant presence as a working partner in the library, collecting and focusing her thoughts with her, set the productive part of her brain into such an overdrive that it blocked out all else, she did not know. But when they left the library at four in the afternoon, having already been there several hours, Bree knew who she wanted to thank, and how.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>They showered together afterwards, dressed, and lay in Bree&rsquo;s armchair, neither ready to part just yet. <q>You&rsquo;re so good to me,</q> Bree whispered as they sat there. Delphine laughed very softly as Bree leaned in to kiss her. It was warm, and Bree found herself waking with her head on Delphine&rsquo;s shoulder. Her friend&rsquo;s eyes with their long lashes were closed. Bree extricated herself from the armchair, pulled a throw from the back of the chair and laid it over Delphine where she slept. It was a little while later that Delphine entered the kitchen, where Bree was stirring a pot on the hob.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q><em>Smells good</em>,</q> Delphine said in French. Bree made a noise of modest protest in an exaggeratedly French accent. Delphine laughed, crossed to the hob and lifted her by the waist. She was only a little taller than Bree, but wearing heels where Bree was barefoot. Bree shrieked with laughter, dropping the spoon into the pot and struggling. Delphine deposited her on the kitchen counter and took over stirring. The stew, Bree’s own recipe as she knew from many previous encounters, was nearly ready in any case. She finished it up and ladled it out onto plates while Bree sat like a pixie where Delphine had left her, singing along to the music playing from her speakers in what Delphine would affectionately describe as an obnoxiously American manner. Eventually, Bree slipped off the counter to land lightly on the floor, put her arms around Delphine’s waist from behind and squeezed before pulling her back and away from the silverware drawer, still singing right into her ear. She slid the drawer open and stole away with the necessaries, but not before Delphine could catch her a playful slap with a dishcloth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree was filling tumblers with water when Delphine brought the stew across. They sat and ate. Bree was still humming between mouthfuls, her body jigging slightly to the music in the background. Delphine was quiet. They both knew that she was the better cook of the two, but she had always shown that she adored this particular recipe, and whenever Bree made it, Delphine seemed quite preoccupied with it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>So,</q> Bree said finally, still jigging, <q>girls&rsquo; night coming up, I think. Alice is free, and Jess has just finished her first coursework deadline.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Sounds good to me,</q> Delphine said. She took a swig from her tumbler, finished the last of the stew and began gathering up her plate and cutlery. <q>Let me wash&mdash;</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>But Bree had already snatched them out of her hands and danced lightly towards the sink. Delphine seized the dishcloth from beside the hob, marched to stand beside Bree, and nudged her playfully with her hips. Bree nudged back, scrubbed a plate clean and passed it to her. Delphine smiled and dried it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Alice&rsquo;s room was the most central and the best furnished for a group gathering, so it was almost always there that they met. Jess opened the door. She was a history major, brown-haired, with very kind green eyes that perfectly matched her personality. As she let them in with soft greetings that could easily be mistaken for shyness by someone who didn&rsquo;t know her, Alice bounded across the room to greet them. Alice was a self-identified nerd who studied anthropology. She wore enormous black-framed glasses that suited her extremely well and had been known to do up her hair in any number of bizarre shapes. Alice was free of all inhibitions and could immediately take control of any dance floor, regardless of her blood alcohol content, but did not seem particularly inclined to romance. She adored Jess, and the latter was almost invariably there whenever Bree visited Alice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Lucy, a lawyer, was another regular and the most outwardly party-prone of the group. She was currently sitting on Alice&rsquo;s sofa, her folded legs swathed in black leather. Her long black hair was sleek and shining, and draped across the back of the sofa was a heavy fur coat that could only belong to her. She rose, rather more slowly and gracefully than Alice had, silver bracelets glimmering on her bare forearms. Her sleeveless blouse was made of some rich white material that felt coarse and elegant as Bree embraced her.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Lucy was prolific in her exploits and was regarded by some of the campus as anything from slutty to plastic. There were times when Bree contemplated murdering these people daily. Lucy had one of the kindest hearts of anyone she knew, and those who counted themselves her friends knew that she cared three times as much about them as she did about sex. Nor was she shallow, desperate, or any of the other adjectives nastily ascribed to her on a regular basis. She knew what she wanted, and she was good at taking it, but call for her help at any time and she would drop whatever conquest she was occupied with.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Alice half-urged, half-pushed them into seats and resumed pouring and serving drinks at lightning speed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>So where are we planning to go?</q> Delphine asked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I suggested Carter&rsquo;s,</q> Jess offered.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;m happy with that,</q> Lucy said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Likewise,</q> Alice put in, depositing drinks in front of Bree and Delphine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Sounds good,</q> Bree agreed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Ok, then,</q> Delphine confirmed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I say we leave in about half an hour,</q> Alice said, plonking her tiny frame down on the smallest seat, a circular pouf on which she habitually sat cross-legged, by her own insistence. The others had given up trying to offer her more comfortable seats. <q>Anyway, Lucy was telling us about her courses this semester.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>You mean boring you with them,</q> Lucy said. She turned to Delphine. <q>What's new with you?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Today I was just helping Bree with her essay. She&rsquo;s behind, again.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree was too far away to reach her, so she simply made a disparaging noise, at which Jess laughed beside her.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>And we went to this amazing lecture two days ago.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree&rsquo;s stomach shifted uncomfortably.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel Hendrix, you remember I was telling you about him, Lucy?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Lucy nodded. <q>You said he was some kind of spoken word genius.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Which is high praise coming from Delphine,</q> Jess put in.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Well, he was,</q> Delphine said simply. <q>We met him afterwards actually, and he gave us his card.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree was not looking at Delphine, but something told her she was not going to mention anything about him and Bree. For that she was extremely grateful.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Good for you,</q> Lucy was saying. <q>Last time I found one of my lecturers inspiring was&mdash;wait, no that hasn’t happened yet.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Alice giggled. <q>I&rsquo;ll second that,</q> she said. <q>Some of my bio-anth professors are so old, either they&rsquo;re gonna fall asleep before the lecture&rsquo;s over, or I am.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>In the end, it was almost an hour before they left. Bree and Delphine took an arm each of Lucy&rsquo;s warm fur coat, and they walked as a three, Alice skipping along ahead of them, Jess practically running to keep up with her. <q>I worry about those two sometimes,</q> Lucy said drily. Delphine laughed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>It was a short way into town and Carter&rsquo;s was on their side of it. Alice and Jess had already gone in when they reached the door. Alice was the only one of them that was regularly asked for ID, and once her age was established, bouncers rarely asked for anyone else&rsquo;s. Jess was the only one of them that was under twenty-one, but since she was almost always with Alice, she rarely had any trouble, and in any case, Alice had long ago provided her with a fake ID. <q>This is how Alice and Jessica do,</q> she had said when she gave it to her. What Alice said, went.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>The other three were not asked for ID, and they descended into the bar to regroup. Carter&rsquo;s had a unique atmosphere among all the bars and clubs in town, and Bree always found herself stopping to look around and take it all in when she first entered. In the time it took her to do this, Alice had decided on a plan of action, and was dragging Jess off to what had become the dance floor. Bree and Delphine exchanged glances, both looked at Lucy, and the three of them moved in unison towards the bar.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Carter&rsquo;s liked to boast that it had the longest bar in town. This was only impressive, they had discovered, because every inch of it was manned, and as a result, it took a much shorter time to be served than it did in most other places. Delphine got the first round, rosé, while Lucy eyed Alice and Jess, and Bree continued to look around. It was only once she had accepted her drink from Delphine and taken a sip that she saw him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel Hendrix was leaning against the bar at the very far end, whisky glass in hand, staring into space. Bree grabbed Delphine&rsquo;s arm and gestured in his direction. Delphine&rsquo;s eyes widened; then a smile began to play about her lips. Lucy caught it and followed Delphine&rsquo;s gaze.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Who&rsquo;s that?</q> she asked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel Hendrix,</q> Delphine said, <q>the lecturer I was telling you about.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>As though he had heard his name, Gavriel looked up at that moment, and his eyes found Bree&rsquo;s. He straightened up and began to work his way towards them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>He remembers you, it seems,</q> Lucy said, looking from him, to Delphine, to Bree, who was uncomfortably aware of Lucy&rsquo;s gaze settling particularly on her. She tried to analyze what her face might be doing, in case she was giving something away, but it was useless, and in any case, Gavriel was only a few feet from them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Hello, again,</q> he said, to Delphine and Bree alike. <q>This is an unexpected pleasure. I&rsquo;m sorry we weren&rsquo;t properly introduced before; perhaps I can make it up to you now.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Delphine,</q> Delphine said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Bree,</q> Bree affirmed. She thought she caught a flash of something like amusement in his eyes at that.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>And this is our friend Lucy,</q> Delphine added. Lucy offered an elegant white hand, which seemed flushed by comparison when Gavriel met it with his own. They shook hands, and Bree thought Lucy gave a slight flinch of the eyebrows when their palms touched.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Well, I don’t want to interrupt anything,</q> Gavriel said. <q>I know a girls&rsquo; night when I see one. I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing from you two again,</q> he said to Delphine and Bree. ‘A pleasure to meet you, Lucy,’ he added, and departed into the crowd.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Well, I&rsquo;ve had awkward meetings with lecturers in social situations before,</q> Lucy said, 'but he seems almost fun.' Delphine laughed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>The evening progressed. Jess made a poorly disguised call for rescue a little while later, and Bree went off to intercept Alice before she found her again. Having had a few more drinks by then, Bree was able to join in with at least a portion of the enthusiasm that Alice was bringing to the scene. Alice had found a dance partner that Bree vaguely recognized from some previous college get-together, and the two were back to back when she arrived. Alice pulled her into the fray, and suddenly she had known the anonymous girl all her life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Delphine arrived later on. They danced briefly with Alice before Jess returned, and Bree wended her way back to the bar. Lucy was standing there, a half-drunk cocktail in her hand. Her hair was coming loose a little, and she had dispensed with her coat. When she saw Bree, she smiled. <q>Get one of these; I recommend them,</q> she said, raising the glass.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree grinned. <q>One of the same,</q> she said to the bartender.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Alice has by now expended maybe a tenth of her energy, I trust?</q> Lucy enquired.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>You wouldn&rsquo;t know it from the way she&rsquo;s going,</q> Bree replied. She was personally of the opinion that Alice didn&rsquo;t have energy reserves. She was quite capable of devouring huge burgers and kebabs on a regular basis, as well as dancing for hours practically non-stop. Neither seemed to affect her physique or level of fatigue. She was simply the world&rsquo;s only perpetual motion machine. One day the Physics Department would realize this and kidnap her. Till then, they would watch over her as they always did.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Lucy stirred her drink thoughtfully with a thin, black straw. <q>This Gavriel Hendrix,</q> she said. Bree restrained a start at the name. She hid her expression by turning to pay for her drink, which had fortunately just arrived.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>What about him?</q> she asked nonchalantly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Is there more to this story that you&rsquo;re not telling me?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Why would you say that?</q> Bree said. <em>How does she know these things?</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Because he can&rsquo;t take his eyes off you,</q> Lucy replied, the corners of her lips slightly upturned, her gaze angled over Bree&rsquo;s shoulder. Bree turned her body once again to take her drink and allowed herself a very swift glance towards the other end of the bar. Gavriel was leaning with one arm on the bar top, another glass, twice as full, in his hand, looking in her direction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>She looked back at Lucy, whose lips were slowly forming a gentle smile, and knew it was pointless to lie. <q>We may have…met again…the other night,</q> she said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Lucy&rsquo;s eyelids widened momentarily, her smile still growing. <q>Bree Brittany,</q> she said, clearly enjoying every word, <q>I do believe you're a little enchanted.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree scowled at her and sipped her drink, having no answer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Go and talk to him,</q> Lucy said, her tone more serious. <q>You told me he was a guest lecturer; he might not be in town much longer, and he&rsquo;s under no professional obligations to refuse.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>What exactly are you suggesting?</q> Bree demanded.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Whatever you choose,</q> Lucy told her calmly. <q>You&rsquo;ll regret it if you don&rsquo;t.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree stirred her drink, thinking.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Whatever you choose,</q> Lucy repeated. <q>And if need be, I&rsquo;ll see the others safely back.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree tipped the rest of the drink down her throat, set the glass on the bar, gave Lucy a look that was equal parts exasperated, incredulous and grateful, and turned to approach Gavriel. He had been looking around, but his eyes found hers again a moment later, and he readjusted himself where he stood leaning on the bar.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel,</q> she said when she reached him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Bree,</q> he said. <q>I take it our meeting the other night is not common knowledge.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Delphine knows,</q> Bree replied, <q>but not Lucy.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Yet she must suspect something now.</q> He was amused. He had the same look of satisfaction as Lucy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Shut up and buy me a drink,</q> Bree said. <q>It&rsquo;s your round.</q> He had offered a last one at their previous meeting, but she had declined.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>He smiled. <q>Any preference?</q> he countered.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Rosé,</q> she said, refusing to break, <q>whatever&rsquo;s affordable.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel held her gaze for a moment, then nodded and turned to the nearest bartender. She took this for a victory.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>You&rsquo;re still willing to come to the opera, I hope?</q> Gavriel asked as he passed her the drink.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>If you haven&rsquo;t changed your mind, I haven&rsquo;t,</q> she said, <q>but if it&rsquo;s a big fancy place, you need to let me pay for my half.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Don&rsquo;t worry,</q> Gavriel said, <q>I&rsquo;m a frequent flyer; they&rsquo;ve given me this one for free.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>So, what are you doing here tonight?</q> Bree asked. <q>Are you with anybody?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>No, I know some of the bar staff,</q> Gavriel answered. <q>What about you? Are you headed anywhere after this?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I haven&rsquo;t decided yet,</q> she replied.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I can work with that,</q> he said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>She looked directly into his eyes. This might be the opportune moment to slap him. Instead, she laughed. He laughed with her, white teeth gleaming in the low light. It was a warm sound.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Lucy looked questioningly at her as Bree made her way back.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>So what happened?</q> she asked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Like you weren&rsquo;t watching the whole time,</q> Bree remarked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Lucy put a hand to her breast in mock-offence. <q>I&rsquo;m horrified that you should think it of me,</q> she said. <q>Come on, what&rsquo;s happening?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;m seeing him again,</q> Bree told her.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Lucy smiled. <q>Yeah?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree found herself beginning to grin back. <q>Yeah,</q> she said. <q>Now for God&rsquo;s sake, let&rsquo;s find Alice a club.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Alice as always insisted on stopping for food on the way back. In truth, none of them were averse to the idea, excepting Lucy, who was the healthiest eater of anyone Bree knew. Alice&rsquo;s favorite joint was neither the cleanest nor the greasiest one in town, but no one they knew had ever taken ill from eating there, so it seemed a fairly perfect compromise between Alice&rsquo;s tastes and common sense. Bree was a regular there too, if not as frequent as Alice, and the short, muscly Greek who ran the counter and never seemed to sleep had once delighted in offering her “Bree and Bacon” grilled sandwiches, but she preferred fries, in this instance shared with Delphine and Jess. Alice as always favored a kebab at least half as broad as her own waist and led them from the shop bearing the smell of chili sauce like a beacon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Lucy was outside, silently and elegantly smoking a cigarette. Bree knew her eyes would have been on them and the street outside in equal measure as they made their transactions. Lucy knew that they could take care of themselves, or she would never leave them to pursue her sex life. But nothing could stop her caring, and since none of the precautions she took ever seemed to interfere with her or anyone else having a good time, Bree had nothing but respect for the attention she gave them. There was no denying in any case that if crisis hit, Lucy would be the one to know what to do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>She did not seem inclined to interrogate Bree further about Gavriel either, for which she was grateful. Delphine would ask for her confidence and she would give it willingly, but Bree was not willing to expand further into their social group with it just yet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>They split once they got back to campus. Lucy headed to her accommodation, Jess and Alice to their block. Bree and Delphine had a short way to go before it became necessary to part.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;ll tell you everything,</q> Bree said as they walked, <q>just not tonight.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Delphine smiled and squeezer her shoulders briefly. <q><em>Bonne nuit, Bree</em>,</q> she said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q><em>Bonne nuit, Delphine</em>,</q> she replied.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>A few lights were still beaming from North West when she reached it. She took off her shoes to climb the stairs, but no matter how slowly and softly she trod, she still heard clangs and squeaks. She stopped moving after a particularly loud one halfway up, but she could now hear the sound of rhythmically creaking bedsprings from one of the nearest rooms, and her guilt vanished immediately. She climbed the rest of the steps a little faster and sank onto her waiting bed.</p>
