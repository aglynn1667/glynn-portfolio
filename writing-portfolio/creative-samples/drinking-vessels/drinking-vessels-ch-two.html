        <h2>Chapter Two</h2>
        <p>Delphine turned to Bree as Gavriel&rsquo;s footsteps retreated into the far end of the department building&rsquo;s long and empty service entrance bay. A smile passed between them; Bree seized Delphine&rsquo;s arm and led her away before they could get caught out of bounds. The blood beating in her eardrums was no stronger than she might have expected from their brisk pace, but she seemed to have become more sensitive to it somehow. Her vision alternated between flashes of the corridors as they passed through them, somehow a little brighter than she was accustomed to seeing them, and images of the virile academic that had just taken his leave of them, both as vivid as each other, rushing before her vision beyond her control. Not two words passed between her and Delphine until they were outside the building, looking at irregular intervals from each other to their reflections in the great glass windows and back again.</p>
        <p><q>Ok,</q> Delphine said, her voice half a laugh. <q>We&rsquo;re gonna need to sit down and talk somewhere.</q></p>
        <p>They like-mindedly crossed the paved avenue of the campus to their usual haunt, the Faculty Café. They passed over the threshold to the usual morning atmosphere. Most of the students in here had only just woken up, either from their beds or from their first lectures of the day, and many wore unnecessary layers, scarves and coats indoors, still not accustomed to waking temperature. The air was as always composed mostly of water vapor, eighty percent hot beverage steam to twenty percent yawn. The line was non-existent, save one pair, their tray already laden with coffee, waffles and French toast, and so it was not long before Bree was crossing the room to where Delphine sat along one of the tall tables in the center bearing drinks, coffee with cream and sugar for Delphine, lemon, ginger and honey for herself.</p>
        <p><q>You&rsquo;re a saint,</q> Delphine said as Bree passed her the cup and climbed onto the bar stool opposite her. She let the rising steam in through her lips with a sigh of contentment and sipped. Bree took a draught of her own mug. <q>You&rsquo;re not coming down with something, are you?</q> her friend asked.</p>
        <p>Bree shook her head, swallowed, and said, <q>I just like the taste of it. They do it well in here&mdash;give you about half a fresh lemon per cup.</q> She offered it to Delphine, who raised it to her slender nose and inhaled.</p>
        <p><q>I&rsquo;ll stick with coffee,</q> she said, offering it back apologetically.</p>
        <p><q>I told you: you&rsquo;re becoming an American,</q> Bree quipped.</p>
        <p><q>Shut up,</q> Delphine retorted through a laugh, <q>more important things to talk about. What did you think of him?</q></p>
        <p>The task of carrying two cups of hot liquid, which never took any less concentration no matter how practiced at it she became, had alone been able to occupy Bree&rsquo;s attention sufficiently to drive Gavriel Hendrix out of her immediate thought. But he had remained on the cusp of her mind since the moment they had parted, and the image of him center stage in the Globe Hall now bloomed in its full might before her.</p>
        <p><q>I&rsquo;ve never met anyone like him,</q> she said. It was the most truthful thing she felt able to say at that moment.</p>
        <p><q>Nor have I,</q> Delphine said, her eyes burning with something more than the steam from her coffee. <q>He reminded me of Ian McKellen, Shane Koyczan and the Cohens all rolled into one, and that&rsquo;s just the start of it.</q></p>
        <p>Bree knew Delphine too well not to recognize all of these names and guess at what recitals and performances she was referring to immediately, but she also perceived that Delphine was giving Gavriel a rare degree of praise. She was not prone to exaggeration or white lying; she was fiercely truthful and refused to make any critical judgement on anything without firsthand experience and proper consideration. This was a Delphine impetuous in judgement as well as in action, and it was a flare Bree had not seen in her often.</p>
        <p><q>After everything you said about him, I didn&rsquo;t expect him to look so young,</q> Bree said.</p>
        <p><q>I&rsquo;m not sure how old he is,</q> Delphine replied. <q>He looks younger in person than he does in photographs. Some people get lucky in that department, I guess.</q></p>
        <p><q>I guess,</q> Bree repeated absently. She was thinking back over his performance—she was no longer sure she could reasonably think of it as a lecture. No sensible discussion of the spoken word could omit Shakespeare, and Gavriel had not skipped over it. She could see him now, one hand outstretched, the fingers splayed and taut, speaking the lines of Lear&rsquo;s curse on Goneril, his features scored with anguish. His eyes had been glistening.</p>
        <p>She brought herself out of her reverie and looked back at Delphine.</p>
        <p><q>What exactly did you want to ask him?</q> she said.</p>
        <p><q>So many things,</q> Delphine said. <q>I wanted to hear more on the contemporary spoken word scene, though God knows he covered it more extensively than our professors have in a year and a half of lectures.</q></p>
        <p><q>We&rsquo;re not set to do the biggest contemporary module until next semester,</q> Bree reminded her.</p>
        <p><q>Yeah, but have you seen the reading lists for it?</q> her friend countered. <q>It&rsquo;s all Ian McEwan and Simon Armitage and two months later you&rsquo;re back with Beckett and Arthur fucking Miller.</q></p>
        <p>Bree smiled.</p>
        <p><q>I want to hear more like him,</q> Delphine said.</p>
        <p>Bree left her retort unsaid, sure it would have occurred to Delphine anyway: it was not just his choice of subject material that had made Gavriel&rsquo;s presentation surpass everything they had experienced at the university so far. The morning had shown them an extraordinary teacher. His knowledge of literature seemed to be as bottomless as it had any right to be, but he had brought it to life in that little lecture hall in a way that even Broadway performances had never done for her.</p>
        <p><q>When are you going to contact him, then?</q> Bree asked finally. Delphine seemed suddenly a little on edge.</p>
        <p><q>Well, we can&rsquo;t do it for at least a few days,</q> she said. <q>He said he&rsquo;s busy, and in any case it wouldn&rsquo;t seem polite.</q></p>
        <p><q><em>He&rsquo;s American</em>,</q> Bree whispered in broken Canadian French, <q><em>you can do whatever the fuck you like</em>.</q></p>
        <p>Delphine laughed. It was a warm, musical laugh. <q><em>With a name like Gavriel Hendrix, I wouldn&rsquo;t trust myself to know where he was from</em>,</q> she replied in much more fluent French. Bree had some Canadian relatives and spent so much time with her best friend that she swore she was picking up her accent. Delphine was pure-blooded however and would hear none of it. They had stayed together in the mountains with Delphine&rsquo;s relatives last year, and while surrounded by the Jepsen family, Bree had sort of seen her point. Then again, she wasn&rsquo;t brave enough to tell Delphine that the strength of her Canadian accent doubled as soon as they arrived there. Delphine would bow to Bree&rsquo;s ear on most things, but her heritage, she was sure, was not one of them.</p>
        <p>They were so caught up in their thoughts that they really did forget the other lecture they had meant to attend that day, but after Gavriel they were sure anything else would seem dull and unimportant by comparison. On realizing, they unconcernedly went back to Bree&rsquo;s room instead and Delphine whipped up a chicken Caesar salad in a matter of minutes. They sat down to this and bowls of onion soup—Bree&rsquo;s recipe—and each meditated silently. Finally, they turned more than a little grudgingly to the question of the paper that was due in a few days&rsquo; time. Delphine had done most of the reading necessary for it, Bree relatively little. Bree promised to meet her in the library a little later on, and Delphine departed, having repeatedly offered to do the washing up and been rebuffed.</p>
        <p>Bree closed the door behind her, tugged her phone from a tight pocket and scrolled through her music library. She felt peculiarly drawn to a playlist of contemporary ballads that she had compiled during one of her messier break-ups—but gave herself a mental shake and continued scrolling. Having made her selection, she strolled back through to the kitchen and plugged the phone into the small set of speakers on the windowsill.</p>
        <p>Thoughts whirled and tumbled in her head as she sponged the plates and bowls. As often as not, Gavriel&rsquo;s face swam before her vision. She knew that washing up was too mundane a process to distract her, so she tried to think about her thesis for the paper, but with less than half the necessary reading under her belt, a coherent train of thought on the matter was still very much out of reach. Any useful processing she could do at this stage would require pen, paper, and an enormously untidy diagram and would likely as not make her thoughts more tangled and confused than ever.</p>
        <p>The track changed, and instantly Delphine came to her mind. One of the last times she had heard this song, they had been sitting on Bree&rsquo;s bed together, a little drunk, having already been talking for hours. Half an hour later they were beneath the covers, Bree in Delphine&rsquo;s arms, feeling her chest slowly rise and fall. Bree stopped work, her hands covered in soapy water, and gripped the edge of the sink, staring out of the window, thinking of Delphine.</p>
        <p>Bree was most comfortable reading in a more relaxed environment than a library. She was liable to work her body unconsciously into a variety of unorthodox, if not grotesque, positions in fruitless search of enduring comfort. But after a few hours at it, she lowered herself from the shoulder-stand-like pose she had been occupying in an armchair in her room, stowed the book in her shoulder bag, and headed for the library. Typing at least had to be done upright, and all serious work was best done with Delphine to keep her company.</p>
        <p>A glimpse upwards through the glass paneling of the upper floors as she climbed the stairs was enough to tell Bree that Delphine was occupying her favorite work spot. First her red leather trousers, then her white blouse, and finally her honey-colored hair came into view as Bree ascended, and on reaching the top, Bree circled around to join her at the far end of a long table lined with in-built desk-lights and strewn with books.</p>
        <p><q>How are you getting on?</q> Bree whispered.</p>
        <p><q>Well,</q> Delphine said thoughtfully, <q>it&rsquo;s a very specific question; I can&rsquo;t decide whether that&rsquo;s an advantage or not.</q></p>
        <p>Bree opened her notes and read the title for the six or seventh time that day:</p>
        <p><em>To what extent is Gerard Manley Hopkins&rsquo; personal transition to Jesuit Catholicism reflected by a tonal change in his poetry?</em></p>
        <p><q>There&rsquo;s a lot in the Mackenzie book,</q> she said.</p>
        <p><q>I know; that&rsquo;s a godsend,</q> Delphine replied. <q>Even so…</q></p>
        <p>Bree restrained a laugh. Delphine&rsquo;s laptop screen showed two pages of type already, and her desk was littered with many more of notes in her tiny, elegant script. Delphine&rsquo;s Literature professors adored her, but they never gave her credit for the sheer amount of work she was prepared to do without feeling like she had done anything at all. Bree adored her, and never gave her enough credit for anything. She put her fingers to Delphine&rsquo;s chin, turned her head, and kissed her.</p>
        <p><q>What was that for?</q> Delphine smiled when they broke apart.</p>
        <p><q>Nothing in particular,</q> Bree replied.</p>
