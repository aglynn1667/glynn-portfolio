<h2>Chapter Eight</h2>
<p>Bree woke in Gavriel&rsquo;s double bed to find herself alone. Daylight was coming through the translucent curtains and the room was a cool grey color. Bree pushed off the black bedcovers and stood up. Her eyes fell upon a black silk dressing gown that had been laid across the end of the bed. Bree smiled and put it on. It was floor-length and cut for a woman. She belted it up and left Gavriel&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
<p>His apartment was modern, elegant, the walls and floor white, the furniture black, with few exceptions. Gavriel was sitting at his table, dressed but barefoot, and with only half of the buttons on his black shirt done up, an enormous volume with a title in Cyrillic in his hands. He looked up when she came in, and he rose. The pallor of his bare torso had been startling in the half-light of the previous night. Now, with the light of day on him, what was visible of his chest looked as though it were hewn from enamel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey,&rsquo; Bree said, sleepily falling into his embrace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Breakfast?&rsquo; Gavriel asked from somewhere above her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fuck breakfast,&rsquo; she murmured into his chest. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna have a shower, but then everything else I do today I want to do with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gavriel chuckled. &lsquo;I expect you&rsquo;ll have changed your mind by lunchtime,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you just shut up and appreciate the sentiment?&rsquo; Bree retorted, still sleepy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I suppose I can,&rsquo; Gavriel replied. Bree kissed him and turned back towards the bedroom and bathroom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You want me to pick up some clothes for you?&rsquo; he called through the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you&rsquo;re willing,&rsquo; Bree said, throwing her keys back the other way into the living room. &lsquo;North West, top floor, room 52.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With effortless speed, Gavriel flashed across the room and caught the keys in mid-air. He ended up standing right in front of her, kissed her once more and left the apartment.</p>
<p>Bree went into his bathroom. It was grey-tiled, but the walls were white as they were everywhere else in the apartment. Snowy white towels were folded on the counter to one side of the marble sink. Bree slipped off the dressing gown he had left her and stepped into the walk-in shower. She smiled to herself as she adjusted the temperature gauge from freezing cold to scalding hot and turned it on.</p>
<p>When she came out, she found that Gavriel had already returned with her clothes and laid them out on the bed. She dressed and returned to the living room. Gavriel was now booted and buttoned and looked up once again from the Russian book.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think maybe you should go back to campus and eat,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yeah, I think you may be right,&rsquo; Bree agreed, &lsquo;all hyperbolic notions of romanticism aside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gavriel laughed.</p>
<p>Bree left. If Gavriel was hungry, she had no desire to be there when he fed. He would know that but would be too chivalrous to throw her out in earnest. She thought she understood the undertone of his suggestion well enough, though. In any case, he was right: she needed food.</p>

<p>In the end, Bree felt she owed Lucy the story as well as Delphine. She suggested that they lunch together at a Japanese restaurant of which they were all rather fond in town. Both readily agreed; it wasn&rsquo;t a busy time of the working week for either of them. Bree and Delphine knew each other so well, and Lucy was so blunt, that it did not take long at all for the topic of Gavriel to come up. Neither of them seemed to feel any particular inclination to avoid the issue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So,&rsquo; Delphine began, &lsquo;you were away last night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you where we think you were?&rsquo; Lucy enquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was with Gavriel,&rsquo; Bree said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And?&rsquo; Lucy knew, she always knew, but the thrill was in the chase.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And we spent the night together,&rsquo; Bree answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew it,&rsquo; Lucy said, with her most lovably self-satisfied expression plastered across her face. &lsquo;No regrets?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None,&rsquo; Bree said. This was not entirely true; something was eating at her, though she had not put her finger on it. But there was certainly nothing that had happened between her and Gavriel that she had not wanted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bree, ma belle,&rsquo; Delphine said warmly, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so happy for you.&rsquo; She stretched out a slender white hand across the table surface, and Bree met it with her own. Their fingers interlocked. Delphine&rsquo;s happiness for her was so manifestly genuine; Bree felt overwhelmed. The distraction of the server arriving at that moment with free appetizers was welcome as it gave her a chance to take a calming breath without the others noticing.</p>
<p>The food was delicious, as always, and conversation with Delphine and Lucy was largely successful in keeping her mind off what Gavriel might be doing for his midday meal. Nothing could stop her from being enormously touched by her friends&rsquo; on-going reactions to her news. Lucy even asked for a dessert menu; this was something she quite simply never did. But special celebrations, she said slyly, were in order.</p>
<p>They walked back to campus together afterwards. Work was calling, with a new assignment&rsquo;s reading for Bree and Delphine and seemingly endless note-making for Lucy. They decided to join her in the law library, a luxurious establishment in keeping with the department&rsquo;s huge wealth, but one with the intense atmosphere that only law students could bring. Lucy sat with her laptop and textbooks on one side of a handsome cherry-wood table, tapping away at her keyboard, while opposite her, Bree and Delphine began the week&rsquo;s reading. It was a far broader topic, latter nineteenth century urban, and they had chosen different texts. Bree had got out the library&rsquo;s largest print edition of the major works of Charles Dickens, which was bigger and heavier than the Russian book Gavriel had been reading that morning. She began with it propped up between her legs and the edge of the table, but after more than an hour&rsquo;s on-going experimentation had resigned herself to the realization that there was no comfortable way of reading the damned thing. Beside her, Delphine was progressing steadily through Baudelaire&rsquo;s Les Fleurs du mal. Bree envied her the smaller, lighter book, but more importantly the fluency to be able to read it in the original French. She could feel, however, with every glance they exchanged that neither of them envied Lucy, patiently devouring law textbooks page by arid page. </p>
<p>Perhaps it was due to the atmosphere of the law library, but for whatever reason, they emerged each surprised and pleased with their progress. Bree, who had avoided Dickens like the plague so far, had been pleasantly surprised to find it readable, and Delphine, already an established fan of Baudelaire, had eaten through most of the book at an almost alarming rate.</p>
<p>They had given up, over the course of their friendship with Lucy, trying to understand how much headway she was making with her work. Everything about her work was complicated, and even explaining how well she was getting on turned out to be confusing and difficult. Lucy seemed to be as relieved as they were that they had stopped asking her. She now offered to make them dinner, and they willingly accepted. Her accommodation was a way off, but none of them cared very much. A beautiful, golden sunset was in progress as they left the library, and Lucy&rsquo;s dry sense of humour kept them laughing throughout the walk back. She was a woman of many talents, and cooked an excellent carbonara, which left Bree feeling relaxed and sleepy. She sat with her head on Delphine&rsquo;s shoulder as her friend tried to explain the resonances of Baudelaire to Lucy. Bree&rsquo;s mind was full of Gavriel. The thought of him was not easy on her mind, somehow. She had meant every word that she had said to him about being willing to stay with him, but she could not quite settle her consciousness. This did not stay hidden from the eagle-eyed Lucy for long.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you thinking about, Bree?&rsquo; she enquired. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re very quiet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ma Bree,&rsquo; Delphine said, &lsquo;est-ce que tu es fatiguée?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Non,&rsquo; Bree replied, &lsquo;je pense á le Gavriel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This much French Lucy could understand. She smiled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel strange,&rsquo; Bree said. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t set my mind at rest for some reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; Lucy counselled, &lsquo;you obviously really like him; in the immediate term, you&rsquo;re not going to be able to think about anything else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was that simple. &lsquo;I miss him,&rsquo; she confessed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Call him,&rsquo; Lucy said. &lsquo;Fuck the masquerade; if you want to talk to him, talk to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bree could already feel the beginnings of a smile at the corners of her mouth just thinking about it. She stood up and pulled her phone from her pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hi, Gavriel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had…an incredible night last night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So did I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause. It was not awkward. It was contented.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve got plenty to be doing, being at college,&rsquo; Gavriel said at last, &lsquo;but I hope we&rsquo;ll see each other again soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;d like that,&rsquo; Bree agreed, smiling to herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be thinking of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I you, goodnight Gavriel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Goodnight, Bree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She hung up and shoved the phone back into her pocket. They were both looking at her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bree,&rsquo; Lucy told her, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t let that one get away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The weekend brought a concerted effort towards the week&rsquo;s essay, with Bree steaming at some pace through Dickens and Delphine alternating between reading a battery of English-language urban poets and writing a new performance poem inspired by her reading of Baudelaire. Despite using entirely different materials, they continued to work together in Delphine&rsquo;s room, and they had been at it for hours when Delphine got a call from Jess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yep, I could use a break.&rsquo; Bree cast the Dickens book dramatically onto the table and stood up.</p>
<p>Alice treated her room like a well-focused blog. She did not have decorations up from more than one fandom at any one time, preferring her room to hold a theme for any given period. Redecorating was a serious business and could not be done piecemeal, so whenever she did it, she asked in her friends and replaced all her posters and ornaments in the space of one afternoon. Nothing was a chore with Alice, and these redecorating sessions were always so enjoyable that they had become something of a recreational tradition.</p>
<p>Alice and Jess had already started by the time Bree and Delphine arrived. One wall was already bare and ready and waiting on the table were Alice&rsquo;s collection of Pokémon merchandise. The remaining walls were still covered with Breaking Bad posters. This was a dramatic change, but Alice did not do any other kind of change.</p>
<p>They set to. Alice was an expert at finding only the best memorabilia, and it was a privilege to be able to examine her decorations in as much detail as redecoration necessitated. On the back of the door to her room was an enormous poster of Walter White, created using some technique Bree could not identify that gave it the quality of a brass rubbing. The image was somewhat hazy, like an impressionistic painting, and half-superimposed on it were the words &ldquo;I am the one who knocks.&rdquo; Directly facing anyone who should dare to enter the room, on the opposite wall, was a Jesse Pinkman poster bearing the legend &ldquo;This is my own private domicile and I will not be harassed…bitch.&rdquo; Around the room were other such gems, including Alice&rsquo;s sports bottle, inscribed with the words &ldquo;Yo, Gatorade me, bitch&rdquo;; her file for biological anthropology, which lay on the desk beside her other notes and on the cover of which were printed the words &ldquo;Yeah Mr. White! Yeah science!&rdquo;; and, Bree&rsquo;s personal favorite, a vast poster of an Alsatian curled around its five puppies, simply inscribed&mdash;above and below the picture in internet meme typography&mdash;&ldquo;Bitch, bitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stripped the posters from the walls, the sports bottle went into a drawer&mdash;along with Alice&rsquo;s one-eyed, fluorescent pink teddy bear&mdash;and only once all was packed away did Alice approach the Pokémon pile. They covered one wall with posters, another with blow-ups of film posters. A plush Jigglypuff, hand-knitted by some relation of Alice&rsquo;s who knew her well, took up presiding position on her desk, and over her desk, Alice put up a huge, extraordinarily high quality, framed poster of Detective Pikachu.</p>
<p>The decorations done, Alice vanished out of the door faster than a layman would have believed possible&mdash;though it did not surprise her friends&mdash;and returned with a steaming plate of what were clearly freshly baked cookies. &lsquo;This is how Alice and Jessica do,&rsquo; she said contentedly and offered them around.</p>
<p>The manual work, though hardly strenuous, had taken Bree&rsquo;s mind off everything else. Idleness and food brought her unease back. Perhaps Lucy was right, and it was simply the distraction of a new relationship, but somehow Bree thought it seemed more than that. Alice&rsquo;s cookies were unfamiliar and uncomfortable in her mouth, and it was all she could do to chew and swallow. Her mind was full of blood and Gavriel. Somehow, she would need to confront this, she was sure. It would not simply fade with time.</p>
