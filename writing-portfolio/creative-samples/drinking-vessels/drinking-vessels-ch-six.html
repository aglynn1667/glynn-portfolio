        <h2>Chapter Six</h2>
        <p>He was waiting outside the lecture halls the following afternoon. He had not answered her voicemail, but somehow it did not surprise her to see him there, eyebrows creased against the sun, wearing a navy suit. She made her way towards him.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gavriel,&rsquo; she said.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Bree,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;will you come with me?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>She nodded, and he led her away from the lecture halls. They were headed in the direction she would normally take to go to town, but as soon as they hit the road, Gavriel turned the other way and led her towards a dead end where the pavement vanished, and a footpath began into the wild. This they trod, maize plants growing in thick rows on either side of them.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;We are free to talk here,&rsquo; Gavriel said as they paced, once they had lost sight of the road. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll know someone&rsquo;s coming long before they do. You sounded very anxious on the phone. What is it?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>He knew. Why was he playing this game?</p>
        <p>&lsquo;I need to know,&rsquo; Bree said, &lsquo;how it&rsquo;s possible that you can be here now, in a photograph taken in the late 1940s, and in a portrait painted in 1853. And don&rsquo;t give me the bullshit you fed Elliot about having a look-alike grandfather; it goes way beyond that. You don&rsquo;t look a day older than twenty-five, but you seem to have more qualifications than it&rsquo;s possible to earn in twenty or thirty years. I found newspaper articles; your name is everywhere, and I know it&rsquo;s the same man.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;I can see that nothing I say will convince you that you are mistaken,&rsquo; Gavriel said. &lsquo;But if you believe that what you say is true, surely you must understand the risk you take by confronting me like this?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;If you meant to hurt me, you&rsquo;d do it,&rsquo; Bree said, &lsquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t warn me first.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;You assume that my warning would give you an opportunity to prepare some defense against me,&rsquo; Gavriel countered. &lsquo;In that you are mistaken.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ll hurt me, Gavriel,&rsquo; Bree said.</p>
        <p>Gavriel looked at her, the muscles in his face contracted.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;You claim to understand me better than you possibly can,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Yet I confess that you are right. Nevertheless, I have no intention of telling you anything more than you already know. I&rsquo;m sorry for your disappointment.&rsquo; He turned to go.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Who are you? What are you?&rsquo; Bree seized his hand to stop him. His flesh was cold. It was like touching glass. She froze, and, seeming to sense this, he stiffened. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re cold,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;impossibly cold.&rsquo; He did not move. The sunlight reflected perfectly off the white skin on the back of his neck. It was flawless, without mark or mar, completely perfect pallor. &lsquo;No blood,&rsquo; Bree murmured.</p>
        <p>Gavriel turned to face her. His expression was resigned, as though some terrible fate had been prophesied for him, and with her last few words, she had confirmed his doom. &lsquo;I am every single Gavriel Hendrix you came across in your search,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m nearly two hundred years old. And I&rsquo;m the last of the race commonly known as the vampires.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>A thousand thoughts flew through Bree&rsquo;s mind at that moment, an inundation of reactions that should have been completely unnavigable, should have left her paralyzed in disbelief, but one, one thought overwhelmingly rose above the rest, and all she could say was, &lsquo;the last?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Gavriel replied, and his eyes were burning, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the only one left. They&rsquo;re gone.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>There was no need to go back to lectures, or indeed to attempt any academic undertaking that day. It was no simple task to convince Gavriel to stay with her. He seemed convinced that the magnitude of his revelation would send her bolting from him at any moment, and his dread of that moment was written on every inch of his flawless face. The complexity of her difficulty was magnified by her own personal confusion. She felt astoundingly calm considering everything she had heard, and a not insignificant, nagging portion of her brain continued to insist that she should be panicking, that she should be thoroughly caught up in her own personal turmoil, rather than trying to help Gavriel out of his. It was immensely distracting, and its wholehearted agreement with Gavriel&rsquo;s point of view made persuading him otherwise twice as difficult. He seemed to read some of her doubts on her face, and she could see that from his perspective, this lent no credibility to her argument.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Just walk with me,&rsquo; she said finally. &lsquo;I know that if you really want to leave, I can&rsquo;t stop you, but I promise you that I want you to stay, more than anything.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>He looked down at her. She met his gaze unflinchingly, challenging him as she had never challenged him before, but this time it was not flirtatious; it was not erotic; it was intense, intimate, passionate. Finally, and with a weariness that made her heart pang even as it validated her determination to stay with him, he turned to face the horizon for which they had been heading, and they began to walk on together, slowly and aimlessly.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;What made you choose this path?&rsquo; Bree asked. She knew that no discussion could be entirely unrelated to the conversation that they had just had, but it was nevertheless necessary to deviate a short way from the dramatic intensity that had passed. Gavriel looked about him.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Apart from its privacy,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;its beauty. I like these plants. They&rsquo;re young, but they&rsquo;re taller than I am. They&rsquo;re thin, but they&rsquo;re strong. They have a youthful vitality I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve still got.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Bree understood. &lsquo;Like me,&rsquo; she said.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;And then, this path leads to the most beautiful natural spot in this area,&rsquo; he said. He paused, and then said tentatively, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show you, if you like.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Somehow Bree knew what he meant. &lsquo;Do you want me to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Climb on my back,&rsquo; he said. She moved towards him and he positioned her arms around his torso. &lsquo;Tell me if you want me to stop,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll hear you.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>She tightened her hold on him momentarily to show that she understood. Over his shoulder, in spite of everything, she could see the traces of a grin beginning to form on his pale features. He started to run.</p>
        <p>Bree had ridden in cars. Bree had ridden on motorcycles. She and Delphine had been to Japan when they were travelling together and had ridden the bullet train from one side of Japan to the other in little over two hours. This was like none of those things. The speed was incredible; maize plants whipped by too fast for her eyes to follow any one row to its end, the perfect colonnades switching from one set of shapes to the next like a superfast flipbook. Gavriel&rsquo;s footfalls were so rapid that they did not seem entirely distinct from one other, and the effect was like neither wheels nor human tread. The wind beat at Bree&rsquo;s face, and her hair streamed gloriously behind her. The hills came rushing to meet them, and with them a small forest, green-leaved and flourishing, the late afternoon sun glowing through the trees.</p>
        <p>Gavriel stopped beside a vast rock in the middle of a small circle of trees, and Bree dropped from his shoulders with his last few steps. She looked at him disbelievingly. &lsquo;How can you question your own vitality?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;When you can do things like that?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Perhaps vitality is the wrong word,&rsquo; Gavriel replied. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that I&rsquo;m deadened. Some folklore says that vampires are dead creatures. That&rsquo;s not the case; I&rsquo;m very much alive. But I&rsquo;m old. Two hundred years is a long time to live; the fact that I can live it doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t take its toll on me. I have all the energy I could possibly need, but I&rsquo;m still weary.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gavriel, we don&rsquo;t have to talk about it&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Yes, we do,&rsquo; he said, and with another impossible movement, his body left the ground, and the soles of his shoes planted themselves on the top of the great grey stone. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t want to stay away from me. If that&rsquo;s the case, there are things you need to know: questions you need to ask, and answers I need to give.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Bree put a foot onto a lower section of the rock and climbed up to join him. They sat side-by-side, legs hanging over the edge of the rock, the glow of the sun through the leaves bathing their skin in gold.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Ask me anything,&rsquo; Gavriel said. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t keep anything from you&mdash;not anymore.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Bree could not deny that she had questions. &lsquo;You mentioned folklore,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;how it&rsquo;s wrong about vampires being…&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Dead,&rsquo; he finished.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Well, what else has it got wrong?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;That seems as good a place to start as any.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Many things,&rsquo; Gavriel said. &lsquo;There are truths in there, buried within a pile of superstitions and prejudices. Before today, had you thought of vampires, what would you have seen?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Fangs,&rsquo; Bree answered, &lsquo;Gothic architecture, coffins full of undead men in evening dress.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;All myths,&rsquo; Gavriel pronounced. &lsquo;Anything else? You must have been forced to read Dracula at some point.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Unfortunately,&rsquo; Bree said, recognizing the contempt in his tone and empathizing with it, on literary grounds at least.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Rest assured I resent it more for its poor literary quality than for its contribution to the blackening of my name,&rsquo; Gavriel told her. &lsquo;That cause was already long gone by the time Stoker got to it. But the stakes, the garlic, the crucifixes, the mirrors, the running water&mdash;he made it all up.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;So, what is true?&rsquo; Bree asked. &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re not the undead descendant of a blood-sucking bat, what are you?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m a predator,&rsquo; Gavriel said, &lsquo;the most terrible and ruthlessly effective of all predators. I&rsquo;m the most dangerous individual creature in this world.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t scare me off, Gavriel,&rsquo; Bree said sharply. &lsquo;Tell me what you mean.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;As far as any of us knew, vampirism is caused by a parasite that feeds on human blood. To get that blood they need a host. They&rsquo;ve drained every drop from my body, but they keep me alive, repair decaying tissue, increase my strength, so that I can get them the blood they need. The thirst I feel&mdash;it&rsquo;s the parasite demanding sustenance, projecting its needs onto me as a craving, an insatiable craving.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;You were human once?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Once,&rsquo; he confirmed, &lsquo;a long time ago. The infection is passed on through our venom.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Who did that to you?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;My sister, Yvette. The Hendrix family were supposed to live forever, rich and happy, the logical conclusion of the American dream.&rsquo; His voice was on the edge of cracking now.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;What happened?&rsquo; Bree could feel a tightness in her eyelids as her reflexes begged her to blink, but she would not break her gaze.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a very long story,&rsquo; Gavriel replied. &lsquo;Suffice to say the dream died, and they died with it, one by one.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>They lapsed into silence. The place to which he had brought her was truly beautiful in the gold of the lowering sun.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t seem afraid,&rsquo; Gavriel remarked.</p>
        <p>Bree did not answer. She was not afraid of Gavriel; he had spent too long fraternizing with her and telling her his secrets to suggest that he meant to hurt her.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Bree,&rsquo; Gavriel said, &lsquo;if you want to walk away now, I will not stop you.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>She kissed him. His response was automatic, but within a few moments, he had begun to return the kiss in earnest. His lips were cold, but they warmed to her touch, and she kissed him until all unfamiliarity was gone.</p>
        <p>They broke apart, and Gavriel&rsquo;s eyes did not leave hers. His fingers moved as if towards his lips but did not quite meet them.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;And now I know,&rsquo; Bree said. &lsquo;I have nothing to fear.&rsquo;</p>

    <div class="section_break">

    <div class="main">
        <p>Lucy&rsquo;s expression when Gavriel entered the bar behind her warmed Bree&rsquo;s heart as much as it infuriated her. They made their way towards her, and with every step, the unrelenting mixture of self-satisfaction and pleasure on her friend&rsquo;s behalf radiating from Lucy&rsquo;s features became more welcome until it was all Bree could do to avoid throwing her arms around her friend. Instead, she said, &lsquo;Lucy, you remember Gavriel.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;From Carter&rsquo;s,&rsquo; Lucy confirmed unnecessarily with a smile. Bree pulled up an extra stool and they sat facing her at the bar.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Yes please,&rsquo; the bartender said, looking at them expectantly.</p>
        <p>Gavriel looked at Bree. &lsquo;I believe it&rsquo;s your round,&rsquo; he said.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gin and tonic for me, Bourbon for him,&rsquo; Bree told the bartender.</p>
        <p>Lucy raised her half-finished bottle of cider to her lips, her eyes flitting between the two of them, still highly amused.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not usually a day-drinker, Lucy,&rsquo; Bree commented.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;I just finished a really irritating paper,&rsquo; Lucy said. &lsquo;I saw no need for celebrations to wait, except that most of our mutual acquaintances seem to be busy. I&rsquo;m glad you brought company.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>The bartender pushed their drinks towards them. Bree paid him.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;What do you study, Lucy?&rsquo; Gavriel asked.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Law,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;a non-starter conversationally. If something&rsquo;s interesting, it&rsquo;s too complicated to explain. I&rsquo;ve been hearing all kinds of interesting things from Bree and Delphine lately though. Tell me about yourself, Gavriel.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Gavriel gave Lucy an appraising look, seemingly impressed by her bluntness. &lsquo;Well, Bree and I met after a lecture I gave at the faculty; I assume she told you that,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I was only a guest speaker. Normally, if I lecture at all, I do it at Columbia.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Your accent isn&rsquo;t East Coast though.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Well, my family&rsquo;s from Virginia originally, but I&rsquo;ve moved around a lot.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;How long before we lose you, then?&rsquo; Lucy asked.</p>
        <p>Gavriel looked at Bree. &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be sticking around here for a while,&rsquo; he said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section_break">
        <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="main">
        <p>&lsquo;You know, Gavriel says you still haven&rsquo;t contacted him,&rsquo; Bree said to Delphine that evening. They had eaten together and now Delphine was lying on Bree&rsquo;s bed, tapping away at her laptop. Bree was curled up in her armchair, immensely comfortable of body but preoccupied of mind, as seemed to be the rule of late.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to get in the way,&rsquo; Delphine said. Of course she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Well, now that things are moving smoothly,&rsquo; Bree said, &lsquo;you should arrange to meet him.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;It seems odd to be so formal, don&rsquo;t you think?&rsquo; Delphine said. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t just act like this isn&rsquo;t going on and it&rsquo;s all professional. Why don&rsquo;t we all meet together as friends?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;We can; I just thought you&rsquo;d like a chance to talk to him about everything you love without anyone else there,&rsquo; Bree replied.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Bree, you&rsquo;re so much more important to me than poetry,&rsquo; Delphine countered. &lsquo;And if Gavriel doesn&rsquo;t grow to feel the same way, he doesn&rsquo;t deserve you. How could you not be relevant to any conversation Gavriel and I might have?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;I just feel like I&rsquo;m taking something away from you,&rsquo; Bree said. &lsquo;Going after him in the first place was your idea. I should have invited you today; I&rsquo;m sorry.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;I was busy; you knew that,&rsquo; Delphine dismissed. &lsquo;Bree, I can tell he&rsquo;s important to you, and you&rsquo;re my closest friend, so of course I want to see him, want to speak to him, want to get to know him. But seeing you happy together would be worth so much more to me than any professional conversation I might have had the chance to have with him.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Bree was on her feet, crossing the room. She shoved the laptop to one side, straddled Delphine&rsquo;s legs, and kissed her. Perhaps their favorite writers could express proper gratitude through words, but not Bree, not at this moment. Her hands fanned out on either side of Delphine&rsquo;s jaw and she kissed her until she could barely breathe.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gavriel,&rsquo; Delphine murmured when they broke apart.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gavriel and I have made no promises to each other,&rsquo; Bree said, and she moved in to kiss her again. They had both had other partners while at college; they had never kept apart for that reason. But they did not have sex that night. They lay on Bree&rsquo;s bed together, fingers locked, Bree&rsquo;s head on her friend&rsquo;s shoulder while Delphine used the laptop on her knees one-handed. No consultation was needed; Delphine simply stayed, and in the small hours of the morning, they pulled the covers over themselves and slept side by side in the single bed without bothering to undress.</p>
