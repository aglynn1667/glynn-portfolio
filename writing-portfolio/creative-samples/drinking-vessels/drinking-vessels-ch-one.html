        <h2>Chapter One</h2>
        <div class="textbox quote">
            <p><em>Don&rsquo;t tell me I don&rsquo;t need you,<br>Like all I need is me</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>It was these words that caught Bree&rsquo;s eye as she spied the notebook on the table and scooped it up. Perhaps it was not common social etiquette to read even your closest friend&rsquo;s diary without express permission, but Delphine was not the most common kind of friend. They had been close since early into their first semester, spent what likely amounted to a majority of their waking hours together, and had almost certainly had sex more times than was entirely typical of what remained only a friendship. The upshot of it all was not that they shared everything. On the contrary, each knew the other so well that to keep something secret from the other was a trifle easier than it would have been had they not been so close. Privacy was easily attainable once they could communicate their needs perfectly to each other without embarrassment and knew each other&rsquo;s boundaries well enough not to stumble upon something by accident. If Delphine had wanted to keep her notebook secret, she would have had no difficulty in doing so, and had she not wanted Bree to look at it, she would not have asked her to pick it up for her. Of this Bree could be quite sure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree could see Delphine at work in just these two lines. She had a particular sensitivity to meter and rhythm, something her professors had remarked upon from time to time, and while the comma at the end of the first line was syntactically unnecessary, in Delphine&rsquo;s mind it would mark a rhythmic pause. With the age of free verse especially, line breaks were no longer any reliable sign of punctuation, and this sentence was not to run on across the gap.</p>
        </div>
        <div class= "textbox">
            <p>The rest of the page was blank however, and there was nothing more she would learn from perusal of the notebook. She shut it and stowed it in her shoulder-bag. She paused to check herself in the mirror on the opposite wall. Her long red hair was straight and flowing across her shoulders, her pale skin was fresh and slightly pink from the shower, and she was pleased with her outfit: denim jacket over a tight miniskirt, leggings and knee-high boots. Satisfied, she left her room.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>North West was hardly the homeliest accommodation on campus, let alone on the American university scene, but the bare walls had livened up once Bree had decorated with posters and pictures, and it was at least well-aired and bright. Even the metal steps down to ground level, which clanged with every step and had reminded Bree at first of a prison, could only be so grim in the light of the morning streaming through the huge single-pane windows, and had almost acquired a fond homely feeling of their own, except when Bree returned to her room late at night, when climbing them without waking anybody was a near impossibility.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>To Bree&rsquo;s surprise, Delphine was waiting for her outside the front door, her honey-colored hair glowing in the sunlight. She smiled and went out to meet her with renewed vigor in her step.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Hey,</q> Delphine said, punctuating her first two words with a kiss on Bree&rsquo;s lips, <q>there&rsquo;s a lecture we need to go to, right now; I completely forgot about it.</q> Bree laughed as Delphine grabbed her hand and pulled her swiftly away in the direction of the lecture halls.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree&rsquo;s accommodation was wonderfully close to the lecture site. Delphine&rsquo;s was much further out, but Bree was not exactly on the way. Still, that was just like Delphine.  She could have had the epiphany of a lifetime, but it would only be half as worthwhile if she could not share it with someone, ideally Bree. Whether she had remembered the lecture only a few moments ago or had simply had too much energy to do something so easy as call Bree&rsquo;s cell, clearly there had been nothing for it but to come straight to North West.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>What&rsquo;s so special about this lecture, then?</q> Bree asked as her friend hurried her through the entrance to one of the lecture blocks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>The guy&rsquo;s supposed to be a genius,</q> Delphine answered, eyes rapidly navigating the bulletin board to check that the location had not changed. Her eyelids flared briefly as she found what she was looking for, and she was off again, Bree running to keep up with her own arm as Delphine pulled it along.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Wait, we&rsquo;re going to The Globe?</q> Bree said as Delphine led her up a flight of stairs she had not used in months. Delphine simply smiled excitedly at her as they hurried along.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>None of the lecture halls in the Literature department were massive; there simply wasn&rsquo;t enough demand for it. There were too many lectures on too specific subjects for attendance to be compulsory and too many eighteen to twenty-one-year-olds on campus not to take advantage of this fact. Nevertheless, for special occasions—usually when well-known writers or famous speakers came to talk—there was one hall in the center of the building that had been designed with numbers in mind. It was circular, with chairs arranged in rings around a glossy black disc of elevated staging in the center. It was known as the Globe, which seemed to be the department&rsquo;s best effort at a Shakespeare joke.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Delphine had not wasted time, and when they got there, seats were still available in the front row. They sat, and Delphine began unloading her stationary.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>So, tell me more about this,</q> Bree said as she passed Delphine her notebook.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel Hendrix,</q> Delphine said, <q>he&rsquo;s a world expert on oral culture. Like, all of it, not just Anglo-Saxon or Ancient Greek or modern performance or anything, all of it. He&rsquo;s got about six different doctorates, speaks about as many languages; he&rsquo;s a genius.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Now Bree knew why she was so excited. Delphine was a spoken word poet. She had made a name, as far as anyone could be said to make a name, for herself on the campus open mic circuit, performing in bars and at special events all across the university. It was a niche market, but Delphine had cornered it. Performance, the voice, oral culture—these were Delphine&rsquo;s specialties, and aside from endearing her enormously to her professors, they appealed strongly to Bree, who came from a musical family and had a very sharp ear. It was clear to her, then, that she could not help but be interested in Hendrix&rsquo;s lecture too, even if she were not quite as excited as Delphine. But Delphine&rsquo;s anticipation was as infectious as it was heart-melting, and soon Bree was riled up almost to equal her.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>She did not know what she had expected, but Gavriel Hendrix was not it. His uncommon name had perhaps suggested one thing, his reputation quite another. Neither was true to life. He was an immensely impressive figure, far younger than Bree had expected. His hair was coal-black, his features smooth and pale, and his build strong and upright. He wore a black collared shirt untucked over dark jeans and black biker boots with silver buckles that glinted in the studio lights and reflected in the polished surface of the stage as he stepped onto it. Antique rings glimmered on his fingers as he raised his hands in greeting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Hello to you all,</q> he said. His voice was smoked like some light cold refreshment or oriental brew or broth. The accent was American, but with hints of both Italian and Russian in it. He had begun facing away from Bree and Delphine but as he turned to each section of the audience in turn, his eyes at last found Bree&rsquo;s, and locked on. It was only for a moment, and the difference in time between the look he gave her and anyone else was almost imperceptible, but it was there, and something flashed across his dark eyes in the split second that they met with hers. She felt a miniscule drop of adrenaline trickle into her bloodstream and her pulse quickened minutely.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>The thesis of the talk itself was unremarkable—like all sensible one-time lecturers, Hendrix had kept his themes broad and was covering great swathes of material in a relatively short period of time—but it was nevertheless more engaging than any lecture Bree had attended at the university before. Hendrix&rsquo; point was that literature was at its greatest when spoken aloud—and speak aloud he did. The words issued softly from his mouth, but they filled the space effortlessly. He spoke slowly, but the effect was hypnotic. At times his voice floated on the edges of song, and Bree felt a tingling in her bare forearms. Delphine had been right: he seemed to speak several different languages, but whatever he quoted, he translated, and even his translations seemed to have a shivering beauty as he spoke them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>It was a long talk, over two hours, but as Bree applauded with everyone else, she realized that for the first time in her university career, she had not glanced at the clock once throughout the sitting. She looked down and felt a little jarred on finding her notepad there, abandoned and blank. She looked back up. Hendrix had not invited the audience to ask questions and was already on his way out on the opposite side of the room. Bree felt Delphine grab her arm.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Let&rsquo;s see if we can catch him,</q> she whispered. Bree obliged, and they rose from their seats, circling around the stage and following a trail of like-minded admirers towards the exit, through which Hendrix had already passed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>He was nowhere to be seen when they finally came through, and the small crowd was disappointedly dispersing. Delphine sighed. Bree linked arms with her and set the pace, recognizing that her friend was uncommonly affected by this particular disappointment and would need Bree to cheer her up. As they rounded the next corner however, they passed the door of a service elevator, which was open, and Gavriel Hendrix was standing inside. They stopped. His eyes passed over them both, once again holding Bree minutely longer in his gaze than her fellow, before beckoning silently to them, his other hand on the open-doors button. With an impetus Bree treasured in her friend, Delphine jumped forward, dragging Bree along with her, and the elevator door shut behind them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>My apologies,</q> Hendrix said as the elevator began to descend, <q>but if it&rsquo;s a choice between ten minutes more on my subject or a Q&A session, I&rsquo;ll always pick the former. Narcissistic, I know, but there&rsquo;s always so much more I want to say.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Could I ask you something now?</q> Delphine asked, as polite as she was visibly on tenterhooks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;m afraid I have to be elsewhere,</q> he replied, with unmistakably genuine regret in his voice, <q>but if you&rsquo;ll take my card&mdash;</q> he produced two business cards and fanned them into a V-shape between his fingers, one before each of them, <q>&mdash;I&rsquo;ll happily answer any questions you have another time.</q> His eyes passed over each of them as they took the cards in turn. Bree felt her pulse quicken almost imperceptibly once again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>You&rsquo;re very kind, Dr. Hendrix,</q> Delphine said with irrepressible warmth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel, please,</q> he said. <q>I mean it,</q> he added as the elevator door opened. <q>I can&rsquo;t bear the titles. How I got through my own graduation is beyond me.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>They stepped out. He took each of them by the hand. His fingers were cool to the touch, despite the rather unnecessary warmth of the central heating, and while his grip was as gentle as it was firm, Bree could feel great strength in the long, pale fingers as she took his hand. A small charge seemed to flow through her arm and once again, as their eyes met, something appeared to be disturbed in the dark pools of his eyes, if only for a moment. <q>A pleasure,</q> he said. He turned and strode towards the exit.</p>
