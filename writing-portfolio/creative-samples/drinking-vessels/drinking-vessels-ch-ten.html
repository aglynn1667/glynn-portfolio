        <h2>Chapter Ten</h2>
        <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s too soon,&rsquo; Jess said firmly, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Not if that&rsquo;s really the way he feels,&rsquo; Delphine argued. Her arm was around Bree, but Bree was looking down at the floor, curtains of red hair hiding her face, and Delphine&rsquo;s voice seemed to come from above her somewhere. She was barely taking in the details of Delphine and Jess&rsquo;s argument. In truth, she had not meant to tell any of them, not yet, but they had forced it out of her.</p>
        <p>It was only when she spoke for the first time that Bree realized Lucy had not contributed to the conversation since its beginning. She had not forgotten that she was there, but the sound of her voice was surprising nonetheless, not least because its tone was curious, slow, contemplative, and with a hint of something like sudden comprehension in it.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;You love him too, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; she said.</p>
        <p>Bree looked up for the first time since the argument had begun, with eyes only for Lucy. She was sitting elegantly in her chair, dressed exquisitely as always and looking at Bree with a touch of an appraising smile. Her lips were closed, however, and she seemed to have no inclination to expand on her realization. As always with Lucy, something had told her that she already knew the truth.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Bree said at last. &lsquo;Yes, I think I do.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;But you didn&rsquo;t tell him that?&rsquo; Alice asked.</p>
        <p>She shook her head. &lsquo;I wasâ€¦overwhelmed, I didn&rsquo;t know what to say.&rsquo; His expression came back to her. What must he be thinking?</p>
        <p>Lucy seemed to know what was on her mind. &lsquo;Go and find him,&rsquo; she said, not vehemently but with surety. Bree met her gaze. Her eyes were as kind as she had ever seen them, but there was an assurance and definitiveness there that struck her more than anything.</p>

    <div class="main">
        <p>When Bree saw the black form hunched over on the far side of the bar, she felt a shock of recollection as the scene perfectly recreated everything that she had felt the very first time she had seen him, yet orders of magnitude stronger. The blood in her eardrums was beating irrepressibly, her heart was pounding, her eyes were wide, and she felt suddenly and sharply aware of the breath flowing in and out of her mouth and nose.</p>
        <p>She had been firmly resolved that she would not have this conversation on the phone, but there had been no answer at Gavriel&rsquo;s apartment, and Zack had not seen him in days. She had been ready to check the Old White Ash, but the most recent haunt he had taken her to was closer, and here he was.</p>
        <p>She crossed the room with determined steps. Time was behaving in a manner she had never experienced, and the journey from the door to the bar seemed to take both an eternity and an impossibly short period. He must have heard her footfalls, and more than likely he had guessed who it was, but he did not turn even when she sat on a stool beside him. His eyes were ahead, but they were unfocused, and she knew he was listening.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gavriel,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I really am; you caught me off guard, and I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, but I do now, and I think you&rsquo;ve known all through this. I love you, Gavriel. I would never have asked you to take my blood if I didn&rsquo;t love you. What happened between us was unlike anything I&rsquo;ve ever felt, and it overwhelmed me. That&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t answer you, not because I regretted anything.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>He had turned to face her as she spoke; his gaze was unflinching now, and she met it head on.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gavriel, I love you. You know that I love you. And you know I&rsquo;d never say it if I didn&rsquo;t know it to be true.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Bree,&rsquo; he said. His voice had always been smoked and aspirate, but only now, after everything, was it husky and cracked. &lsquo;Bree, I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Kiss me,&rsquo; she said softly.</p>
        <p>He stood up. His delicate fingers rose to trace the line of her jaw on either side of her face and he bent to kiss her.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section_break">
        <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="main">
        <p>They stayed until closing time. Two glasses of Bourbon and two gin and tonics were all that they went through, for the most time lying forgotten on the bar top as they spoke together, hardly taking their eyes from each other. Gavriel&rsquo;s white teeth gleamed now and then in the low bar light as he smiled, and Bree found herself laughing more often than ever before. Again and again, her eyes examined his face, his perfect white complexion, his dark eyes, and the flash that now seemed to light them up as often as not.</p>
        <p>The night air was chill when they left the bar, but the vampire stood tall and unabated as the wind played at his leather jacket and his coal-black hair, and Bree tightened her coat about her.</p>
        <p>Perhaps they were walking vaguely in the direction of Gavriel&rsquo;s apartment, but then again, perhaps they were not. Bree felt contented to stride through the city streets with Gavriel until the sun came up, and he gave no indication that this was not his deepest desire too. They left the main road with its bright lights and entered the maze of alleys and back-roads, but these roads had never looked more beautiful. For once, there was no Shakespeare, no forbidden Russian lyric, no Mongol proverb on Gavriel&rsquo;s lips. There were no words for him tonight.</p>
        <p>The silence was perfect until they heard voices from up ahead. Gavriel&rsquo;s brows contracted as though what he heard displeased him, though Bree could not make out the words. Then again, the closer they got, the more the tone sounded angry.</p>
        <p>The scene came into view before them. The couple were standing together just outside the pool of light from an orange street lamp. They had been out somewhere; she wore a skirt far too short for the temperature, and her glossy black heels were huge and gleamed in the lamplight. She was laughing, but it was increasingly nervous laughter, in keeping with the increasingly aggressive behavior of her companion. He was less elaborately dressed, plain apart from the large, golden crucifix on a thick chain around his neck, and his angry features were clearly closer to hers than she would have liked as she backed into a wall.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Something funny?&rsquo; he was demanding.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Back down.&rsquo; Gavriel had not raised his voice or called out. With the same immaculate penetration with which his words had filled the Globe in the Literature Department, this short, cold expression crossed the distance between him and his quarry with perfect clarity. In those two monosyllables Bree could hear a tone she had never experienced in his voice before. It lacked the surprised outrage of outright contempt, the arbitrariness of outright command, or the malevolence of pure malice. This was neither something that surprised him, something that could inspire the same anger it might have done in his younger days, nor a complex matter requiring insight to understand. It was simply something he would not tolerate.</p>
        <p>The youth turned, one hand still gripping the young woman&rsquo;s jacket. &lsquo;What?&rsquo; he said, as though he could not believe his ears.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Let her go.&rsquo; Gavriel&rsquo;s voice was colder than his skin had ever been, and as Bree looked up at his face, she saw an expression that frightened her. His jaw was not clenched, his brow was not furrowed, but something in his features, in his eyes, which for the first time since she had known him were showing their two hundred years, was terrible, like nothing she had ever seen.</p>
        <p>If the youth had started at this sight, he readjusted himself quickly and released his companion in an exaggeratedly deliberate manner, for a moment holding his hand fixed, fingers spread, in the air where her jacket had been, as though he were a disdainful housemaster releasing a disobedient servant following punishment. His girlfriend took one look at Gavriel and made her exit, breaking into a run a few steps from the youth. He was now advancing with swaggering steps towards Gavriel. His frame was broad, the vast bulk of his muscles visible through his clothing. His hair was shaved down almost to a buzzcut, and his wide, spade-shaped jaw suggested extremely high testosterone.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;You got a fuckin&rsquo; death wish, boy?&rsquo; he demanded, cracking his knuckles as he approached. His eye fell on Bree. &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m gonna enjoy this.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Bree did not have time to cry out. Gavriel&rsquo;s movement was impossibly fast; he was gone from beside her, his hand was at the youth&rsquo;s collar, and he was thrusting him against the wall in a fraction of a second. The youth was wide-eyed and staring as one hand jumped to the crucifix at his chest. &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; he half-blurted, half-gasped, breathless, eyes darting up and down Gavriel&rsquo;s body. &lsquo;What are you?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;GAVRIEL, NO!&rsquo; Bree screamed, but her protest died in the air as the vampire lunged for the youth&rsquo;s throat. There was a sickening tearing sound as he bit into the soft flesh. Bree jerked around as Gavriel fed, looking anywhere but at the scene before her. She heard the body slump to the ground, and Gavriel came up behind her, lifted her onto his back, and fled, all in one fluid motion.</p>
        <p>Gavriel took a direct route to his apartment, ascending a fire escape in the space of seconds and crossing the city grid at roof height. They swiftly reached the top of his own apartment block, where a small concrete construction sheltered the stairs down into the building. He took the heavy padlock in hand and wrenched it down, breaking it easily, and they took the stairs four at a time down to his floor.</p>
        <p>The beautiful apartment now seemed garish in the artificial light, and Bree could feel nothing but the oppressive atmosphere of an interrogation room as she sat on the sofa where Gavriel had left her. She heard running water, and soon he emerged from his bedroom, his mouth cleared of blood, wearing a fresh shirt.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Bree&mdash;&rsquo; he began.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gavriel,&rsquo; she cut across him, &lsquo;I never wanted to see that, never.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;I never meant you to see it. I always meant to do it as far away from you as possible.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gavriel,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that wasn&rsquo;t a planned kill. You didn&rsquo;t hesitate; you attacked him, viciously. You didn&rsquo;t know anything about him.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;I knew everything I needed to know,&rsquo; Gavriel threw back at her, and the cold was back in his voice. It was twice as terrible when he was speaking to her. &lsquo;He was ready to force himself on her without a second thought, and if he&rsquo;d had the chance, he&rsquo;d have done the same to you.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;So that&rsquo;s what you do, is it?&rsquo; Bree demanded. &lsquo;You make a choice about someone&rsquo;s right to live based on a few seconds? I thought you hated nothing more than taking human life. From what I just saw, it&rsquo;s easy to think you revel in it.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Revel in it?&rsquo; Gavriel snarled. &lsquo;I hate it; I hate every drop of blood that I have spilt. But I tell you, Bree, I cannot be anything other than what I am. Killing is what keeps me alive.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Then why don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
        <p>She stopped. Her voice had caught in her throat. Her heart had momentarily stopped beating; her stomach and her throat were full of bile. And more than she had ever felt, even in the worst moments of her life, she hated herself for the words that she had been about to utter.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Say it,&rsquo; Gavriel spat. She did not speak. She did not move. &lsquo;Say it,&rsquo; he growled again. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t I just let myself die? Have you wondered all along?&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gavriel, no, I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Well, let me tell you something my kind learned centuries ago: the body always outlasts the will. I&rsquo;ve seen it happen; the closer we get to death, the more dangerous we become. I could have the strongest resolve of any vampire who ever lived, but when the bloodthirst took over, no ethical misgiving would hold me back, and nothing on this earth would be able to stop me until I&rsquo;d had my fill. I&rsquo;d be raiding the apartments of every man, woman, and child in this building, and this time, I would be going for their throats.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>He was pacing now; every time he turned, the anger in his face seemed to renew itself as he held her horrified gaze.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Even if I could find some way to contain myself, to stop myself from breaking loose and killing everyone within reach, I don&rsquo;t know how long I&rsquo;d survive. I can&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rsquo; he faltered &lsquo;&mdash;I can&rsquo;t know how long I&rsquo;d be in pain, unendurable pain.&rsquo; He swallowed. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s only one other way to end me: rip my body apart and burn it. But I can&rsquo;t do that myself. If you want me to die, you&rsquo;ll have to be the one to hold the torch.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Tears had been rolling silently down Bree&rsquo;s cheeks as she listened to him imagining his own death, but this last seemed to wrench her heart right out of her body.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gavriel,&rsquo; she whispered, &lsquo;I would never do that.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said bitterly. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not capable of such ferocious violence. Until tonight, I dared to believe that I wasn&rsquo;t either, not anymore. But I was afraid, and I was angry. What he was about to do was unconscionable, and I&rsquo;d do the same again.&rsquo; There was a horrible chill in every word, and Bree had never been so sure that he meant what he said.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gavriel,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I could never be the one to do that to you. But the man I loved&mdash;he was a killer, but he wasn&rsquo;t a murderer.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>The vampire had no answer for that. He simply watched her face as she stood and readjusted her coat about herself.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Goodbye, Gavriel,&rsquo; she said. She kissed his cold lips, turned, and left the apartment.</p>

    <div class="main">
        <p>Bree refused to see anyone for the next few days. They all tried to reach her&mdash;Delphine, Lucy, Alice, Jess&mdash;but she rejected their calls and simply sent them messages saying that she was fine and wanted to be alone. Two days in, Delphine and Lucy knocked on her door, insisting that she let them in, but she refused, and eventually they gave up and retreated. Bree sent an email asking for some flexibility with the week&rsquo;s paper deadline, but that was the extent of her contact with the outside world. She skipped lectures and left her room only to make herself food, and while her dreams were filled with images of Gavriel and red blood running everywhere, as far as she knew, she never once made a sound as she slept, for no one came to complain.</p>
        <p>It was only on the fifth day, when Bree did not even bother to call out an excuse on hearing the knock, that Delphine finally opened the unlocked door and came in. Bree made no attempt, verbal or physical, to stop her. She lay on the bed looking up at Delphine without the slightest inkling of what to do. Delphine sat on the bed and looked at her friend with all the affection and sympathy that could be imagined, and Bree felt the tears begin to roll down her cheeks.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Gavriel?&rsquo; Delphine asked.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;I lost him, Delphine,&rsquo; she whispered. &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s worse than that I never had him. He was never the man I thought he was.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Delphine sat with Bree long after she lost track of time. She held her hand, she embraced her, she lay beside her on the single bed, their fingers interlocked, and let the time pass in perfect silence. A hundred thousand thoughts filled Bree&rsquo;s head, as they had been doing for the last five days. They were no less fast, no less vivid, no less confused and chaotic, but Bree could not have expressed with any words the comfort that Delphine&rsquo;s presence brought her.</p>
        <p>She knew it before she was aware that she knew it. Part of her had known all along, but somehow, she had never allowed herself to fully believe it or even acknowledge it as a possibility. But now, as wave after wave of realization flooded over her of who Gavriel was, and what he had done, one thought, constant as Delphine&rsquo;s presence, constant as her tireless dedication to Bree&rsquo;s well-being, bloomed like a seed with its first drop of water.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Delphine,&rsquo; Bree whispered, &lsquo;I should have known all this time.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Delphine was resting on one elbow, her eyes on Bree&rsquo;s face. Bree shifted to look at her. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s always been you,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Him too, I thought, but always you.&rsquo; Bree looked into the eyes of the person she knew better than anyone else in the world and knew that she understood. But it did not matter. This time, when it was true beyond all possible doubt, she would say it. &lsquo;Delphine, I love you.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Bree,&rsquo; Delphine replied, a smile breaking through, &lsquo;I love you too.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Stay here with me?&rsquo; Bree asked.</p>
        <p>Delphine leaned across very slowly and kissed her softly on the lips. &lsquo;Forever, if you ask me to.&rsquo;</p>
