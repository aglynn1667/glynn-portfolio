        <h2>Chapter Five</h2>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel met her at the Virginia Monument, which marked a halfway point between campus and the town center. He was wearing a plain black suit with a black shirt, but his collar was open, he wore no tie, and his shoes, while polished, lacked the mirror brightness that distinguished the opera buff. This was enough to convince Bree that she had chosen well; she wore a knee-length dress, tights, and leather boots with one of Lucy&rsquo; fur coats, blue-grey and warm.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>You look beautiful,</q> he said simply when she stood before him, and his sincerity was beyond doubt.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>She heard his voice, looked into his face, and all the sensations she had experienced on seeing him for the first time came flooding back with twice their force. He locked eyes with her, and she knew that there was no need to say anything in return. He knew.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>They walked slowly into town together. The moon shone brightly down and illuminated Gavriel&rsquo;s perfectly black and white figure. His rings glinted on his fingers, and his pallor was startling. They did not speak, but from time to time, they glanced at each other, the smiles that played around their lips mirroring each other in their slightness, their subtlety, and the pinch of mischievousness in each.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>While their destination, as Bree had suspected, was about as highly prestigious a musical institution as Gavriel could have chosen to frequent, the Whittaker Concert Hall was at least a modern building that lacked the gaudiness of any of the town center&rsquo;s theaters, let alone the one that dared to call itself an Opera House. True, the clientele was still likely to be black tie and champagne, but Gavriel had promised her that the tickets were free, and in any case, he had clearly not bothered to live up to the standard that she imagined the event would generally expect. This gave a reassuring, though little-needed, credibility to the conversation that had led up to his invitation: clearly, they were here for the music, not the décor.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>The entrance was bright, the lighting from the foyer beaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows. They entered behind a couple of other guests in tuxedos and followed them around a corner.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Laid out before them was a reception, white cloth tables with champagne and canapés everywhere, men in dinner jackets and women in long dresses orbiting them. Bree looked at Gavriel, her eyebrows raised.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>It&rsquo;s an anniversary gathering,</q> he said. ‘The recital’s in a few minutes. I made sure we missed most of the pleasantries.’</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree laughed and allowed him to take her coat. A waiter in a bow tie and waistcoat took a few slow steps towards them and offered them a tray of champagne flutes. Gavriel took two.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I promise you,</q>he said as he held one out to her, <q>none of this cost me a penny.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree clinked glasses with him and sipped. She was unimpressed. Taste was not the strongpoint of any alcoholic beverage. She took a side-step to a table and lifted a canapé on its odd little half-spoon, half-tray contraption. Of what bizarre, gooey foodstuff precisely it was made she did not know, but it tasted good enough.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel was watching her.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Take one,</q> she said, gesturing to the platter with a parody of the grace of an Austenian lady. Gavriel shook his head. <q>They&rsquo;re good,</q> she said, widening her eyes at him, <q>and free.</q> She lifted another from its platter and stepped towards him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Don&rsquo;t,</q> Gavriel said. She stopped. There was an odd tang in his voice, an urgency that she had never heard in his calm, composed tones before.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>What&rsquo;s the matter?</q> she asked, setting the thing back down on the table.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>It&rsquo;s nothing,</q> he said, his eyes trained on a point somewhere over her left shoulder.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Come on, Gavriel; you can tell me.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>He let out a small, single laugh, still not looking at her. <q>They don&rsquo;t always cater to my allergies is all,</q> he said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Oh,</q> Bree said, taken aback, <q>I&rsquo;m sorry; I didn&rsquo;t realize.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>It&rsquo;s fine,</q> he said swiftly, <q>don&rsquo;t apologize.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>At that moment, there was the sound of a teaspoon on glass, and the room was hushed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Ladies and gentlemen,</q> came the British-accented voice of a man in white tie, tall, botoxed, and with viciously combed hair, <q>if you would please take your seats, the performance will begin in five minutes&rsquo; time.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>The hubbub resumed as the guests began to move towards the open double doors on the far side of the room.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Shall we?</q>Gavriel said, his cool fingertips at her bare shoulder. She started slightly&mdash;but allowed him to steer her towards the doors. There they were met by the Englishman who had made the announcement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel,</q> he said warmly, <q>I&rsquo;m so glad you could come.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Good to see you too, Elliot,</q> Gavriel replied, smiling. <q>Bree, this is Elliot Grayson, director of music here.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>A pleasure.</q> Elliot inclined his torso to Bree. <q>I trust the refreshments were to your liking?</q> he added to both of them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Excellent well,</q> Gavriel answered. <q>I trust the musicians are to yours?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Yes, yes, they will not let me down,</q> Elliot said jovially.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>They passed into the hall and took seats in the second row of the four beside an elderly gentleman with a cane and his wife. A few moments later, a door to one side of the performance area opened and the audience began to applaud as the musicians entered. There were five of them, two women in exquisite floor-length dresses&mdash;one grey, one white&mdash;and three men in tails. They all bowed, before one of the men strode to the exquisite black piano and sat beside his waiting page-turner.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>The recital was skilled, intimate, and short enough to be enjoyable&mdash;Bree had not been sure if she were cut out for a four-hour Mozart masterpiece. One of the men had a particularly beautiful voice, and Bree applauded his solos especially. When it was over, they followed everyone else back into the reception area, where the tables had been restocked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Want to get out of here?</q>Gavriel murmured. Bree laughed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel! Miss Bree! How did you enjoy the concert?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>They turned to see Elliot before them, a hopeful smile on his features.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Very well,</q> Bree said, taking charge, <q>particularly&mdash;who was it who did the last of the solos?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Ah, that would be Mr. Alexander,</q> Elliot said, <q>a fine young tenor just come to us from Oxford.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Nothing but the best,</q> Gavriel remarked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Yes indeed,</q> Elliot said enthusiastically, <q>in fact&mdash;</q> he turned to gesture behind him towards a display in a corner of the room <q>&mdash;let me show you the photographs. We&rsquo;ve finally got the oldest ones in from storage. They haven&rsquo;t been on display since the company left the first concert building. Might be a familiar face or two for you, Gavriel.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>He led them to the corner, Gavriel seemingly reluctantly, Bree curious at this last comment. Elliot put a finger triumphantly to the photograph at the top left of the display, which showed a fussy formal gathering in a much older room full of carpet and wallpaper. It was clearly a whole company photograph with everyone standing in rows, and beside Elliot&rsquo;s immaculately filed fingernail was a pale figure with dark eyes and coal-black hair that were distinguishable even in a grayscale photograph.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Wait,</q> Bree said, checking the date beneath the photograph. <q>But that&rsquo;s&mdash;</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>My grandfather,</q> Gavriel said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>One of the founders of the company,</q> Elliot said delightedly. <q>Hendrix is a very popular name around here, I can tell you.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>The likeness was startling, and Bree looked from one to the other in wonder.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Well, it&rsquo;s been a wonderful evening, Elliot,</q> Gavriel said, clapping him on the back, <q>but I really must let Bree go home.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Yes, of course,</q> Elliot said. <q>Miss Bree, it has been a pleasure.</q> He bowed once again and scuttled off to take care of his other guests.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Let&rsquo;s go,</q> Gavriel said. Bree donned Lucy&rsquo;s coat and took his offered arm.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Outside, the night was dark, but the moon still shone brightly overhead. The streetlamps glowed warmly in every direction, and the shadows of pedestrians grew and shrank in the light of passing headlamps.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;ll walk you back, if you like,</q> Gavriel offered.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>No need,</q> Bree said. She was conscious of his agitation, though whether its source was greater than the mannerisms of an overenthusiastic musical director, she could not tell. <q>Thank you, Gavriel, for a lovely evening.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>He looked down at her as though surprised that she had enjoyed herself. She restrained another laugh and took his upper arms in her hands.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>See you soon?</q> she asked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Of course,</q> he said, with a chivalric courtesy that made her smile. She turned and headed off into the night.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>As she walked, one thought would not leave her mind&mdash;the photograph. She had seen strong likenesses between fathers and sons before. She had done volunteer work in a care center for elderly and wounded veterans and could recall a man called George Maberly, who always had a picture of his son beside him, the skin less lined, the hair less grey, but otherwise incredibly similar in face. But a likeness of the kind she had just witnessed was something new. The man in the photograph had looked exactly like Gavriel; he had the same flawless, perfectly symmetrical face, the same dark eyes with the same glass-like quality that came out even in the background of a grayscale photograph. Was it possible that grandfather and grandson could look so alike?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Lost in these thoughts, her feet carried her steadily home to her room in North West, where she shrugged off Lucy&rsquo;s coat, grabbed her shoulder bag, and removed her laptop from it. A name as distinctive as Gavriel Hendrix was bound to get some results. She opened the laptop, fired up Google, and typed it in.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>As she had suspected, it did not take her long to find relevant pages. Her search took her through to the archives of the Whittaker Academy. Gavriel Hendrix was one of ten names on the list of the founders of the academy. She pulled up his biography and speed-read it. There was no mention anywhere of any children. Bree went back to the search results. The next item of interest was an archived column from a Cambridge University student newspaper. It was a feature on outstanding performances by students in the humanities. The center of the feature seemed to be the lawyers, some of whom had secured highly lucrative opportunities in top law firms during their final year at the university. Lower down in the article came a somewhat understated section on the other faculties:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox quote">
            <p><em>We are delighted to say that this year has been a highly successful one for the arts. We extend our special congratulations to historian Flynn Christian for his exceptional dissertation on the Third Crusade and to Gavriel Hendrix for his work on oral culture in both Classics and English faculties.</em></p>

            <p>Bree frowned and checked the date of the paper. 1926. Was Gavriel so unimaginative that he could think of nothing better to devote his life&rsquo;s work to than a study in which some forefather of his had already triumphed? She clicked back to the biography of his grandfather and ran her eyes down it a little more slowly. The word “Literature” jumped out at her, and she started.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox quote">
            <p><em>Hendrix studied Comparative Literature to a high standard at Yale University but chose to use his family&rsquo;s wealth to patronize musical institutions.</em></p>

            <p>The Whittaker Academy had been founded shortly after the Second World War, Bree remembered. Yet the man in the photograph looked young and fresh-faced. Could he be a son? But that left only twenty years or so between the Cambridge article and the founding of the Academy. In any case, what family knew such a consistent pursuit of academia in the same subject? She Googled “Gavriel Hendrix Yale University” and found his name on an ancient list of prize-winning dissertations, his subject: “Oral and Performative Influences on European Literature from Shakespeare into the Later 17<sup>th</sup> and Early 18<sup>th</sup> Centuries”.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree could feel her heart beating fast now. She took a wild guess and typed “Gavriel Hendrix Harvard University” into Google. The first relevant page she found was from the department of anthropology:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox quote">
            <p><em>The department has been thriving on a new wave of eclectic subject choices, from Darwinian studies on the evolution of human promiscuity to discussions of pre-literary art forms and methods of communication.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>This last phrase was hyperlinked and footnoted. The hyperlink had long expired, but the footnote read, “reproduced by kind permission of Gavriel Hendrix.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>An impossible thought had been growing in the back of Bree&rsquo;s mind, and the more she read, the harder it was to ignore it. It did not seem any less absurd as time went on, yet the mounting evidence seemed to point more and more explicitly in that unthinkable direction. But it was only when she looked at the image search that Bree knew she had stumbled on the truth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>A small thumbnail with a gold border had caught her eye among the sea of photographs. She clicked on it, determined not to believe what she was seeing until she could make it out properly, but the preview was no bigger than the thumbnail. The website description identified the picture as one of many portraits produced by the forgotten artist George Paine. Bree searched his name, scanned the results for a suitably niche-looking website, chose her spot, and clicked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>The page seemed to go on forever, portrait after dull portrait of grim-looking families in formal attire of the nineteenth century. Eventually however, she found what she was looking for.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>The portrait had been photographed in its elaborate golden frame, but the image was large enough to make out the faces clearly. They had been positioned before a fireplace, a typical old-fashioned scene, the mother and father seated on an embroidered couch in the middle, their five children standing around them. Beside the haughty-looking mother stood two handsome men, one brown-haired, one blond, their gentlemen&rsquo;s outfits tailored but in exactly the same style. Behind the wizened old father stood two women. They were blond, smiling and identical, wearing matching blue dresses. Beside them stood Gavriel Hendrix. His hair was longer, in keeping with the fashion of the time, and he wore an outfit identical to those of his brothers, but in all other respects he was the spitting image of the Gavriel she knew. The photograph was just large enough to take in the plaque at the bottom of the frame:</p>

            <p>Bree sat back in her chair and stared. She did not know what to think. The sighting of some evidence for the implausible leads to a kind of panic in the brain as the witness tries desperately to reconcile what they have seen with their understanding of the universe. The relief that comes on recognizing their mistake is welcome and highly palpable. Now that Bree had discovered the impossible to be beyond reasonable doubt the case, she felt the release of vindication, but it was marred by the stirrings of realization: the magnitude of what she had just discovered was inestimable. She quite simply did not know how to process it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>It took a few moments for her to decide what to do, but she was not aware of any decision-making process taking place. She simply ended up facing the window, eyes unfocussed, phone to her ear.</p>
