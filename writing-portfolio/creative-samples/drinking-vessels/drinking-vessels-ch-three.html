    <h2>Chapter Three</h2>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>When Bree woke the next morning, it was from uneasy dreams. She and Delphine had gone their separate ways when the library closed, each to work on the essay. Alone in her room, Bree had found it impossible to concentrate. The already confusing poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins became an impenetrable maze of corrupted syntax and complex alliteration. Notes on the Jesuits and the Oxford movement littered her desk, confused and disordered. Eventually Bree had given up, and lain in bed with her headphones in, trying to let pop rock calm her as it normally had no difficulty in doing. Instead she hovered on the edge of sleep, never quite sure which side she was on, until her alarm rang, and she found herself tangled in bedcovers and headphone wires. She extricated herself, got up, and made straight for the shower. It was scalding hot, as she liked it, and her hairdryer was deafening, but nothing could shake her mind from its determined course. Washed and fully dressed, she turned from her wardrobe, caught up her shoulder bag from the desk and rummaged through one of the pockets. Her fingers felt the hard edge of the card, clasped it and pulled it out.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>It was plain black, with no mark of any university or organization, but simply in grey-white letters, “Gavriel Hendrix PhD” followed by a standard American cell number. She sat on her bed, tapping the card against her chin. She could not have put a finger on what exactly had prompted her to look for it. Her dreams had been indistinct at best, black and shapeless at worst. But this was all she could think of now. She was only mildly conscious of her fingers as they reached into her pocket and retrieved her cell phone. She put the number in softly without registering what the individual digits were. They seemed to move from her eyes to her fingers without bypassing her mind. She put the phone to her ear; the plastic felt unfamiliar and slightly uncomfortable against her skin.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel Hendrix.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel, hi, it&rsquo;s Bree Brittany, we—</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><quo>—met yesterday, after my talk. Yes, I recognize your voice. You&rsquo;d like to meet again, I take it?</quo></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>A beat. <q>Yes,</q> Bree said. It was almost as though the reply was yanked involuntarily from her lungs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>There was a longer pause. Then he spoke again, his voice unfaltering, but sounding somehow uncertain of what reception it could expect. <q>If it&resquo;s not too bold to ask, could you spare some time this evening? My calendar is quite full but tonight of all nights I do have an hour or two.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I—that is, I would,</q> Bree replied, <q>but Delphine has a class tonight; she couldn’t make it.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Then would you come on your own?</q> Gavriel asked, his voice exerting a little more pressure. <q>I&rsquo;d be more than happy to meet with Delphine another time.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I don&rsquo;t think I can go without her.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Does she know you’re calling me now?</q> His tone was curious; he seemed to guess more than he was explicitly letting on. There was a pause. She had no answer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;m still in town as it happens,</q> he said. <q>Do you know the Old White Ash?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Yes.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Would you meet me there around seven?</q></p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p>Several streams of thought, all vivid and colorful, passed through Bree&rsquo;s mind, full of images of Delphine, yet a moment later she found herself saying, <q>yes, I&rsquo;ll be there.</q> Her voice felt stiff and unlike herself.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>OK then. I hope you don’t object to me storing your cell number in case something comes up?</q> he said.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>No, that&rsquo;s fine,</q> Bree replied. <q>See you later.</q></p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p>She hung up and shoved the phone into her pocket. She now discovered she was breathing a little more heavily than usual. Her pulse had accelerated a fraction and once again the blood in her eardrums, while no louder than normal, was somehow less easy to ignore.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p>In the end she had to skip breakfast to reach her lectures on time. It gave her a jolt to see Delphine waiting for her outside the faculty, a pair of sunglasses nestled in the waves of her hair. They walked inside together, Bree&rsquo;s head working fast.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p>If it had been difficult to concentrate yesterday, it was nothing compared to today. She kept thinking that she should call it off with Gavriel, and wait until they could both see him, but something dark and made of steel seemed to hold her back every time she got close to doing it. Nor did she have the courage to tell Delphine what had happened. Something had settled in her gut, an awareness she was afraid to confront—the awareness of why she had done what she had done, and the knowledge that she would not be able to stop herself from going through with it. But she hid from it and attempted to lose herself in her work. This was easier said than done; the maze of the previous night had now become an impenetrable barrier, and she could not begin to untangle the twists and turns of Hopkins&rsquo; Dark Sonnets. She simply stared blankly at the page as thoughts of Delphine, of the phone call and above all of her meeting with Gavriel that evening beat at the insides of her skull.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p>Slowly, agonizingly, the time passed, and somehow she had come up with something that resembled an essay outline. Delphine left smiling for her class, though she had asked Bree several times that day whether she was alright. Bree could not remember exactly how she had feigned her wellbeing. Nothing she had said or done that day was entirely in focus.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p>The Old White Ash was a lesser haunt of students of the university, as it was not the closest bar to any of the accommodation sites. It got a look in with a niche crowd however, and every so often a university bar crawl would wend its way there. Bree had been once or perhaps twice before, and could remember little of its surroundings, but she found her way there by the appointed time. The bar was quiet, with only a low murmur of conversation and the occasional gentle tap from the pool table. Gavriel was nowhere to be seen.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree sat at the bar and ordered a gin and tonic. The bartender looked her up and down and turned to make the drink. The door to the bar opened and Bree turned to see Gavriel enter. He wore a white collarless shirt and a black leather jacket. He had the same boots on his feet and the same rings on his fingers as he joined her at the bar and laid his hands on its wooden surface.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Double Bourbon,</q> he said and turned to Bree. <q>Bree,</q> he said.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel,</q> she replied. His eyes were on her again, the same dark flash in them as before, and her heart was beating faster, but this time the adrenaline gave her a rush of her own impetus and she challenged him, meeting his gaze with a hint of a smile. His lips parted to show a glimpse of his own white teeth.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p>The bartender set Gavriel&rsquo;s drink beside Bree&rsquo;s untouched one. Gavriel reached nonchalantly towards his pocket, but Bree knew what he was about to do and beat him to it.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>This round&rsquo;s on me,</q> she said, dropping a couple of bills onto the bar top. Gavriel&rsquo;s hand stopped and slowly returned to the bar. Their eyes met, and the look he gave her was appraising at least as much as it was amused. <q>To life, literature and the consumption of liquor,</q> he said as he lifted his drink from the bar. They clinked glasses.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I am to take it that you enjoyed my talk, then,</q> he said as he set down his drink. His fingers were long and elegant, and their every movement seemed careful and communicative, as though they were speaking a language more sophisticated than common gesticulation. <q>Or at least, if you did not enjoy it, then there was something in it sufficiently jarring or plain wrong to your ears that you had to take it up with me.</q></p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I enjoyed it,</q> Bree replied. <q>Of course I enjoyed it. Do you often get students assailing you with their opposing views?</q></p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>From time to time,</q> Gavriel answered. <q>That&rsquo;s part of the point really. Literary criticism has always been a dialogue. It is in the nature of critics to exaggerate or self-parody their viewpoints. Take a piece of early English criticism like Ben Jonson&rsquo;s <q>A Fit of Rhyme Against Rhyme</q>. Of course he didn&rsquo;t expect readers to take him entirely seriously. Criticism is made so extreme or so paradoxical that it provokes reactionary viewpoints. Of course it is in the nature of human beings that reactionary viewpoints are always more extreme than their proponents&rsquo; true values. The dialogue is there not so that either party can be right, but so that a slightly more cool-headed individual, an open-minded student, let&rsquo;s say, can find the middle ground, the golden mean, between all the extremities. So, in that sense, if people disagree with me violently enough to challenge me about it, it means I&rsquo;ve done my job.</q></p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>It&rsquo;s a shame you were so convincing then,</q> Bree quipped, <q>but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not in any position to be your opponent in dialogue. You&rsquo;ve had a wasted trip.</q></p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel laughed and raised his glass to his lips. <q>It seems we are doomed to be allied then, Bree,</q> he said, and sipped. <q>So,</q> he continued, setting the glass down once again, <q>talk to me.</q></p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Well, the spoken word is more Delphine’s area than mine&mdash;</q></p>
        </div>
         <div class="textbox">
             <p><q>I promised you: I will speak to Delphine,</q> Gavriel cut across her. <q>I won&rsquo;t let you down. You&rsquo;re here now; tell me, what sticks in your mind from my talk?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Lear,</q> she said without thinking. She was not sure entirely why, but it was the one thing that had lodged in her head most of all, and there was nothing she wanted him to elaborate on more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>King Lear,</q> Gavriel murmured. <q>The greatest, and most terrible, of all Shakespeare&rsquo;s speeches: if no parent should have to bury their child, what do we say of a man who wishes infertility on his own daughter? What can we possibly think of a man consumed by a hatred so great that he will wish the worst of all pains on his own child? Nothing so simple as the end of her life, but an inner, parasitic death, to snuff out the bloodline and an eternity of potential offspring, and the knowledge, the consciousness of that impossibility. Infertility is a condition that has been known to drive women mad. And think of life itself, the improbability of it, the tiny chance that brought the first microscopic organisms into being amid infinite sterility, and the achingly slow growth of life breeding lilacs out of the dead land against all possible odds. Against that, to wish for barrenness is the most destructive instinct imaginable. Is there a hatred more terrible in the universe that what must have inspired that speech?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>You believe life has some sort of sanctity?</q> Bree asked. Gavriel shook his head.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Nothing is sacred,</q> he said, <q>but there is the flourishing and there is the futile, and I know which side I want to be on.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>He was a thoroughly striking figure. So much more happened behind his dark eyes than he was even letting on now. The darkest recesses of his mind seemed to be blacker than his coal-colored hair. She wondered how much of what he had said to her came from personal experience, what he might have seen that would make him read so deeply and darkly into the text.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>OK,</q> Bree said at last, brushing a curtain of long red hair behind one ear. <q>Tell me more about you, then.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>At Cambridge they taught me it was a grievous sin to use biographical details in your analysis,</q> Gavriel replied without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>And you agreed?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel grinned. <q>Of course not. No one believes anything their supervisors tell them at Cambridge, at least not in the English faculty. But I&rsquo;m not a great writer; what makes you think my background is at all interesting?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Has no one ever tried to make small-talk with you before, Gavriel?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>They have,</q> he answered, almost musingly, <q>but it doesn&rsquo;t strike me as your style.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Where are you from?</q> she asked, ignoring him. <q>Obviously most of your life must have been in the States, but there&rsquo;s more than that in your accent.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel raised his eyebrows. <q>What else can you hear?</q></p>

            <p><q>Italian,</q> she said, <q>only a hint, less than an Italian-American, enough to be audible. And a little Russian, I think.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;m impressed.</q> He sounded it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>You needn&rsquo;t be; you spoke both languages in the talk,</q> Bree said. She was not sure why she was bringing the conversation back to the talk. Gavriel seemed to have become a little guarded as soon as they got onto more personal matters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Yet it takes a keen ear to tell a native speaker from an adoptive one,</q> he countered. <q>I wonder, are you musically inclined at all?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>It was dark by the time Bree left the bar and made her way back. She checked her phone and found a message from Delphine: <em>Hey, class finished early, come to mine? I have beverages</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>It was rare that Delphine&rsquo;s texts did not make Bree laugh. She wasn&rsquo;t quite there even now, but she felt a pang thinking about Delphine, unaware that she had gone behind her back. She texted back and took a side road to lead her towards Delphine&rsquo;s accommodation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>It&rsquo;s open,</q> the Canadian voice called when she knocked, and Bree entered to find Delphine clearing a space on the table, which was covered with notes, papers and her laptop. <q>That was quick,</q> she said, straightening and moving towards her. She went in to kiss her and stopped, nose to nose, her own nostrils flaring slightly. <q>You started without me,</q> she said with a grin, and kissed Bree on the lips. <q>Where have you been?</q> she asked, pulling her towards the table and scooping up a six-pack of cider.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree couldn&rsquo;t lie to her. <q>I was with Gavriel,</q>she said. Their eyes met.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I thought you might be,</q> Delphine answered, a smile hinting at the corners of her mouth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I shouldn&rsquo;t have gone without you,</q> Bree continued apologetically. <q>I&rsquo;m sorry. He says he&rsquo;s more than happy to see you some other time.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>All&rsquo;s well, then,</q> Delphine said. She opened one of the bottles and offered it to Bree. Bree took it, confused.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I thought you&rsquo;d be upset,</q> she said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Oh come on, Bree; how well do I know you?</q> Delphine said, half laughing. <q>I thought you might want to see him alone, and believe me, if I was right, I wasn&rsquo;t desperate to force myself on your company. I am right, though, aren&rsquo;t I?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>She didn’t need an answer; she was smiling in earnest now, but Bree thought she owed her one anyway. <q>Yes, I think you are.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Good.</q> Delphine sat and swung her legs up onto Bree&rsquo;s lap. <q>Tell me everything.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I think,</q> Bree said, <q>he invited me to an Italian opera.</q></p>
