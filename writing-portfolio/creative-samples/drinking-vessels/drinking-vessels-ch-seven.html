        <h2>Chapter Seven</h2>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>You need to stop just showing up like this,</q> Bree laughed as she made her way towards Gavriel where he stood beside the entrance to the lecture site.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Oh, but it&rsquo;s so much quicker than calling,</q> he replied, removing his uncommonly small-framed, flat, and tasteful sunglasses and stowing them in the pocket of his leather jacket. Bree pushed him playfully but wound up with his upper arm in her grasp.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Where are we going?</q> she asked as they left the lecture site.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Wherever you like,</q> he said, <q>I just wanted to see you.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I need a drink,</q> Bree told him thoughtfully.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Let&rsquo;s work with that,</q> he said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>The bar Gavriel chose was one that she had never visited. It was dark, with red lampshades dotted about the place, and great, black, low couches in booths. Bree made for one of these while Gavriel stepped up to the bar.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>My usual,</q> he said. He turned to Bree, looking questioningly at her.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Twice,</q> she answered.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Twice,</q> Gavriel confirmed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Coming right up.</q> The bartender was bald and stocky and seemed to have some Native American blood in him. He was wearing a loose, orange beach shirt with the sleeves rolled up&mdash;exposing his tattooed, meaty forearms and the ends of huge biceps&mdash;and the collar open to the third button, showing thick chest hair and a number of necklaces. He set to work with the deftness of a long-time bar owner. <q>So, you in town for long this time, Gavriel?</q> he asked as he worked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;m not sure yet,</q> Gavriel replied. <q>Depends on how good that drink is.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>The bartender, cocktail shaker poised and ready, stopped, set it down, and said, <q>well, just remember you asked for it.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>He reached beneath the bar top and brought out an unmarked decanter full of honey-colored liquid.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>That&rsquo;s never&mdash;</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Yep,</q> the bartender confirmed, producing three crystal glasses and pouring a shot into each. <q>Finest scotch this side of the Atlantic.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel beckoned to Bree before turning back to the bartender. <q>How did you get him to part with it?</q> he asked as Bree rose and came to join them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Not without difficulty,</q> the bartender replied.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>To difficulty, then,</q> Gavriel said, raising his glass. Bree mirrored him, and they drank. Gavriel and the bartender were exchanging expressions of bliss. <q>Damn, that&rsquo;s good,</q> Gavriel half-whispered, one sip in. Bree could not fault it; it was scotch, but where their ecstasy was coming from was anyone&rsquo;s guess.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>What are you going to do with it, Zack?</q> Gavriel asked, leaning his forearms on the bar once they had finished their glasses and the bartender had set about making the cocktails once more. His voice had taken on a tone of awe from the moment the bartender had produced the scotch, and Bree&rsquo;s heart was melting. Elbows on the bar beside his, she nudged affectionately at his arm with her head and rested her temple there.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>We&rsquo;re going to drink it,</q> Zack pronounced, pouring the cocktail mixture over ice with a look of fire in his eyes, <q>every fucking drop, tonight; are you in?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Are we in?</q> Gavriel asked. She craned her neck to look up at him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Don&rsquo;t see why not,</q> she said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Done,</q> Zack said. <q>Be here at the usual time.</q> He pushed the drinks towards them. They carried them back to the booth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>His brother&rsquo;s a moonshiner,</q> Gavriel explained, <q>can get hold of anything, but he&rsquo;s not usually so generous.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree sipped at the drink that Gavriel had ordered. It was an aggressively garish blue-green color and bit her tongue like pure lemon juice. It was also delicious.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>&rsquo;House specialty,</q> Gavriel told her. <q>Zack calls it <q>Sex on Stalin&rsquo;s Grave</q>.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree laughed mid-sip, and the drink went up her nose.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Zack, it transpired, lived in the two stories above the bar. Though he had originally told them to come back later, after a while, he insisted that they stay and whipped up steaks for all three of them. They ate in his kitchen, which, like the rest of the rooms, was dotted with what looked like Indigenous artefacts. Zack saw her looking.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>That&rsquo;s a dream-catcher,</q> he told her, nodding at a wooden ring threaded with a web of strings with tassels dangling from it. <q>My mom had narcolepsy, so my old man used to keep them in every room of the house.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel laughed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Were both of them&mdash;</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Indians?</q> Zack finished. <q>No, only him. His family went crazy when he told them. Traditionalists.</q> He snorted. <q>Fuck &rsquo;em all, right Gavriel?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel chuckled. Bree looked questioningly at him. <q>Jews on one side,</q> he said, <q>French Catholics on the other. They ended up naming half the kids each.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>And the families?</q> Bree asked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Neither was happy,</q> Gavriel confirmed, <q>not that that was a problem for very long.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Zack did not laugh at this, and Bree decided that he did not know more about Gavriel&rsquo;s family history than he was letting on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Not long after they had eaten, friends of Zack&rsquo;s started to arrive. Some, like him, seemed to have Indigenous roots. Others were common White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, though not one of them was as pale as Gavriel. Most of them seemed never to have met him and made introductions to him and Bree alike. The trend was male, but there were a couple of women, and one part-Native girl in a sports bra and fishnet gloves, introduced as Carrie, embraced Bree like a sister and chatted to her as though they had been friends for years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Is it bad that I don&rsquo;t get this?</q> Bree asked her as the others around them sipped their whisky with exclamations of bliss.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Of course not,</q> Carrie reassured her. <q>I like a good drink as much as the next girl, but this&mdash;</q> she nodded her head towards a pair who were moaning softly together as they drank <q>&mdash;I do not understand.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree laughed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>So,</q> Carrie said, <q>did you come with the good-looking guy?</q> Her eyes flashed in Gavriel&rsquo;s direction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>If you mean Gavriel,</q> Bree said, grinning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>No way, that’s Gavriel?</q> Carrie said, looking less subtly now. <q>Zack&rsquo;s talked about him a lot. He&rsquo;s all mysterious like, only shows up like once every few years, and they get blind drunk every night for the next month.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>But they never invited you?</q> Bree asked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>No, well, I was only seventeen last time it happened,</q> Carrie said. <q>Hard to get into all the best bars with a kid tagging along.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>What else did Zack tell you about him?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>He&rsquo;s old money,</q> Carrie told her, <q>drinks expensive drinks; I assume that&rsquo;s how they met originally. Comes from some old-time, early-settling family out of Virginia. Now he&rsquo;s never in the same state two years running.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>She seemed to realize what she had just said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Maybe he&rsquo;ll stick around longer this time,</q> she offered by way of an attempted repair.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>It&rsquo;s fine,</q> Bree reassured her. <q>I know he&rsquo;s always on the move. We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>So, you and him are thing then, right?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Yeah,</q> Bree said, looking across at the pale figure sitting with Zack, <q>I suppose we are.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Soon, the whisky was finished, several members of the party were drunk, and one of them sat abruptly between Bree and Carrie, looking at the latter unblinkingly as though at a long-lost lover.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;ll handle this,</q> Carrie said. Bree laughed and went to look for Gavriel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>She found him on the balcony outside, a bottle of less sterling spirit in his hands. <q>Rowdy lot, aren&rsquo;t they?</q> he said, offering her the bottle. She took it and swigged. <q>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting there to be this many,</q> he added.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>They seem like good people.</q> In truth, Bree had only really spoken to one of them, but she had no reason to believe any ill of Zack&rsquo;s friends. <q>You&rsquo;re something of a legend, apparently.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel laughed. <q>Yes, I get the impression Zack talks about me quite a lot.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Carrie said you only see him every few years.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>It&rsquo;s an unfortunate necessity. Zack&rsquo;s a straightforward guy; if he noticed anything odd about my appearance, he wouldn&rsquo;t care enough to concern himself with it. If I keep the same job in the same town too long though, some start to realize I&rsquo;m not looking any older. One day I&rsquo;ll have to stop seeing Zack too. He can&rsquo;t ignore it forever.</q> He looked at her. <q>Bree, there are still things you don&rsquo;t know about me, although you might have guessed them, I suppose. But they&rsquo;re questions you need to ask.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree had been dreading this moment, but he was right. The truth was important.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>How do you feed?</q> she asked him, finally.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>By killing,</q> he said. <q>I wish there were another way, but there isn&rsquo;t. When my race was at the height of its numbers, we used to have blood slaves, human beings kept alive and in captivity to be fed on, but I&rsquo;m not capable of putting a person through that. So, I can&rsquo;t leave any of my victims alive, not once they know what I am.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>You can&rsquo;t survive on anything else?</q> Bree enquired.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>No,</q> he said wearily. <q>If I try to eat solid food or animal blood, I throw it up.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>And alcohol?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel laughed. <q>I think it dumbs the parasites down a little. Certainly, it takes the edge off my hunger.</q> He grew serious again. <q>I&rsquo;m sorry Bree, but I have no other answer for you. I&rsquo;ve killed a lot of people, and I&rsquo;ll have to kill many more.</q></p>

            <p><q>But then, what am I?</q> Bree said. <q>A step down the food chain, that makes me…a pet.</q></p>

        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel was shaking his head. <q>Bree, I can&rsquo;t tell you what you are to me. I need to let you walk away, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to do that beforehand.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel, I&rsquo;m not going anywhere,</q> Bree told him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;m a killer, Bree,</q> Gavriel said sharply, his expression grim, <q>how can you want to stay with me?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel, you&rsquo;ve just told me you&rsquo;ve tried everything in your power to find another way to feed,</q> Bree said. <q>You&rsquo;ve just told me you can&rsquo;t stand to see human beings suffer, and you&rsquo;re willing to starve yourself to the point where you need alcohol to keep you sane. Of course I want to stay with you. You&rsquo;re one of the most incredible people I&rsquo;ve ever met.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel was simply looking at her. There was a kind of disbelieving relief in his eyes that floated, oil on water, on a well of regret and weariness. <q>Bree,</q> he said, <q>you are the one person worth staying here for, worth risking it, worth daring to live like I&rsquo;m not the last of my kind. That&rsquo;s what you are to me.</q></p>

        <div class="textbox">
            <p>He kissed her, and as their lips met, she felt an arm at her back, then another behind her legs, and the soles of her shoes left the ground. She opened her eyes as he vaulted upward and landed lightly on the roof. He took three steps from the edge and set her on her feet, but mere milliseconds passed before he was kissing her again.</p>
