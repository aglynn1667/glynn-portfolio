        <h2>Chapter Nine</h2>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>It was a relief when Gavriel finally called her. Nothing, she was sure, would set her mind at rest but to confront her uneasiness face to face with him, and while the vividness of the images in her mind&mdash;the blood red and garish, lurid against his binary black-white form&mdash;was precisely the problem, only in the flesh would Bree have a chance of resolving her doubts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>She had no plan, but she knew, had determined, that at least the process of reconciling what he was with who he was had to start that day. Oddly enough, now that she knew the reason for his borderline alcoholism, Bree was very happy to embrace it. It was a very human part of his condition, a coping mechanism that was familiar to her, even if it had never seemed exactly sensible. She was neither surprised nor displeased at his request to meet her at a bar, therefore.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>He was there already when she arrived, wearing a black blazer a few shades less formal than the suit he had worn to the opera recital, dark jeans, and a relatively casual linen shirt. Nevertheless, he was as ever the most striking figure in the room. She sat beside him, slightly hunched over his drink.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;ll have a single of whatever he&rsquo;s got,</q> she told the bartender, who nodded sourly and set to work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Glenfiddich,</q> Gavriel told her, <q>it&rsquo;s quite shit but itâ€™s distracting.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree laughed and leant over to kiss him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>So, how are you getting on?</q> Gavriel asked, and then grimaced. <q>Two hundred years go by and that question doesn&rsquo;t become any less dull to ask&mdash;or any less necessary.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Dickens is surprisingly not killing me,</q> Bree told him, <q>although I envy Delphine being able to do Baudelaire as a primary discussion text.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I think Baudelaire&rsquo;s images are strong enough to be meaningful in translation,</q> Gavriel said, <q>but I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to work them into a discussion of Dickens. If there were any less eroticism in Dickens, he&rsquo;d have almost as great a spiritual high ground as he seems to have thought he had.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>The theme is the urban,</q> Bree told him, <q>I&rsquo;ve left spirituality out of it.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Well, he&rsquo;s good on the city,</q> Gavriel granted, <q>though I don&rsquo;t know his London that well; I was still in America for most of Dickens&rsquo; life.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>When did you leave?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I travelled a lot throughout, but I didn&rsquo;t move to a permanent residence in Europe until the Twenties. I got an apartment in Paris. Plenty of interesting people to talk to: I could&rsquo;ve met Fitzgerald and Hemmingway if I&rsquo;d known what they were going to become.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>They passed an hour or more in the bar, drinking and talking, but without knowing quite why, Bree was drawn to move on somehow, and she was sure that Gavriel felt the same. He was showing his usual signs of agitation, talking in relatively short sentences, drinking at an uncommon rate, chuckling softly at many things indiscriminately, no variation in volume according to how funny he found any given thing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Eventually, they strode out into the night air together. It was cold and rousing, and everything from the rumble of the individual cars to the thud of Gavriel&rsquo;s boots sounded clearly in Bree&rsquo;s ears. She looked up at him. His pale face was a perfect screen for the glow of car headlights and traffic signals, and his eyes were dancing with their reflections. His body did not seem to suffer from changes in temperature as much as a human body did, and as Bree pulled her coat up around her neck to shelter from the wind, he let it billow around him without flinching as it disturbed the skirts of his blazer feebly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Let&rsquo;s go back to yours,</q> Bree said, already chilled. Gavriel nodded, and they began to walk briskly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>His was truly a beautiful apartment. It was spotless, with not a mark or mar on its white floors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>How often do you actually stay here?</q> she asked, curling up on his black leather couch as he went into the kitchen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Not that often.</q> He emerged bearing a crystal decanter and two matching glasses.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Then where do you sleep?</q> Bree asked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>He chuckled softly, but this time it sounded different, warmer, if full of the irony that made him Gavriel. <q>I don&rsquo;t,</q> he said. His amusement, unless he disguised himself better than she yet knew, was too genuine for Bree to allow herself to indulge in the horror of this idea. Instead she laughed with him as he sat and poured.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>There is so much time,</q> he said musingly as he passed her a glass. She took it but did not drink, watching him as he mulled it all over. <q>It is a gift as much as it is a curse. When I was at university for the first time, it was nightmarish. So much time wasted doing nothing, such inefficiency. These were the days before I realized that the work of an academic in Classics or Literature is literally never over, but I thought if only I could get my work done at night, I could spend more time doing things I loved during the day.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Hasn&rsquo;t your work always been your first love?</q> Bree asked him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Not always,</q> he said. <q>Back then English Literature wasn&rsquo;t really a subject, and Classics was full of ecclesiastical writing, dreary, repetitive and above all uninspiring, written by academics for academics, and if ever meant to be spoken, intended for the ears of those who could not understand. What kind of literature is that? I wanted to go out drinking. That was what we all wanted, what we all did. Once I became a vampire, it was basically a necessity.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>He clinked glasses with Bree and drained half of his in one swallow. Bree took a sip from hers and set it down on the coffee table.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I have all the time I could want,</q> Gavriel said, <q>time for everything I want to do.</q> He was refusing to add the small print, but Bree knew it anyway. She shifted towards him and kissed him. The cold no longer felt strange to her, but the tenderness of his response was still remarkable. She felt little more than a light shiver across her skin as his fingers pulled the coat from her arms, leaving them bare. She answered with his jacket, then his shirt and undershirt. He broke away from her and removed her dress in one fluid motion. Eyes closed, she felt waves of irresistible tension pass under her skin as his lips roved over her body. She felt the suction on her flesh, the scrape of teeth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>He stopped. They were both breathing heavily as Bree opened her eyes to meet his. They were full of an eclectic mixture of guilt, ecstasy and fear, the pupils wide.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Go on,</q> she whispered. The turmoil on his face deepened. <q>Go on,</q> she told him. <q>I trust you.</q> From his eyes she knew that an understanding had passed between them, and after an endless moment of infinite tension, he bowed his head. And as his teeth sank into her flesh, Bree&rsquo;s mouth opened, and she let out a shriek of rapturous pain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox center">
            <p>~~~</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>You look...happy,</q> Gavriel said as they lay side by side on his bed. There were dark patches on the black linen covers, and beneath the sheets were stained with blood. Bree lay on her stomach, resting her head on her forearms, looking sideways at him, a curtain of red hair falling over one eye.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I am,</q> she said simply. <q>I wanted this, Gavriel; I asked you to do it. It feltâ€¦right.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>It...wounded you.</q> Gavriel&rsquo;s voice was pained.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>It felt good.</q> Bree&rsquo;s was light and straightforward. She was telling him the truth. The pain had been sharp, agonizing, and perhaps the most extraordinary sensation she had ever felt. She could not have borne it a moment longer, yet as it had been, she had felt ecstatic. There had been a greater rush of adrenaline in those moments than she had ever felt. He had bitten into the soft flesh of her abdomen and her lower body had been drenched in blood. And beneath that&mdash;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>How can you be so content with this?</q> he demanded.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel,</q> Bree said, turning to support herself on one elbow, her breasts rising and falling before her, <q>it made me come.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>There was a silence. Gavriel looked at her with a flame growing in his eyes as though he were daring himself to believe her. There was a passion, an addiction in his expression, and she knew that she was more to him now than she had ever been. There would never be a more perfect moment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I want you to take my blood,</q> she said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Muscles locked like pistol hammers in his face. His jaw tightened; his eyebrows contracted; his nostrils flared.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;m assuming that it won&rsquo;t be enough to sustain you fully,</q> she continued, refusing to let herself be thrown off, <q>but it could reduce how much you need. You don&rsquo;t need to kill me; I&rsquo;m not a risk to you.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>You want to be a blood slave,</q> Gavriel said. His voice was dark, grim, and disgusted. <q>Why would you wish that on yourself?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>It&rsquo;s only slavery if you don&rsquo;t want it,</q> Bree countered. <q>I want this, for myself and for you.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I can't ask you to do that,</q> Gavriel asserted.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>I&rsquo;m asking,</q> Bree said, <q>not you. Of course you would never ask me. But I&rsquo;m telling you: I want this.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>She had moved closer to him as she spoke, and with her final word she kissed him. He responded willingly, and when they broke apart, she saw that same look in his eye that he had worn when he agreed the first time. She turned and tilted her head to expose her jugular, but he shook his head. Bree closed her eyes as his lips touched her skin, passing down her body to her side. He bit at the narrowest point in the hourglass, and when his teeth sank into her flesh, a little more softly this time, her spine straightened involuntarily, her head jerked back with a gasp. She let out her breath in an exclamation of exquisite pain as she felt the blood draining from her veins. Contractions of a kind she had never felt ran rife in her torso, as though her muscles were fighting to keep her remaining blood flowing. She did not reach orgasm a second time, but by the time Gavriel was done, her body had been racked with shudders.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>She covered the bites with Band-Aids and took a shower. There was no thrill of revulsion as the bloody water spattered the floor. She felt the drain of the blood she had lost, but much more than that she felt the calm, the contentment that followed sex. When she emerged from the bathroom, he was sitting on the edge of the bed waiting for her. She joined him, and with long, white fingers, he removed the first of her bandages. He sewed up her wounds himself, handling the needle and thread with such dexterity and such tenderness that she could only watch him as he worked in silence with a sensation of the deepest affection seeming to radiate from her eyes, her forehead and the front of her nose.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Why not my neck?</q> she asked him as he finished the last stitch. <q>Isn&rsquo;t that the easiest place to draw blood from?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>The jugular is the most vulnerable part of your body,</q> Gavriel said. <q>That&rsquo;s where&mdash;</q> he swallowed. <q>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d bite if I meant to kill. Sleep now,</q> he added, briskly moving on from this thought. <q>I&rsquo;ll stay with you.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>Gavriel, you don&rsquo;t need to&mdash;</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>There&rsquo;s nowhere I&rsquo;d rather be,</q> he told her. She knew she could believe him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>She slept, and she woke to find him still there, as he had promised. An enormous, one-volume edition of Proust&rsquo;s <em>Ã€ la recherche de temps perdu</em> was open against his legs. He seemed to interpret the look she gave him perfectly, for he said, <q>I&rsquo;ve been alive nearly two hundred years; I don&rsquo;t bore easily.</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree laughed. Gavriel shut the book with a heavy slap of pages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>There&rsquo;s no way in hell I&rsquo;m not buying you breakfast this time,</q> he said. <q>Come on, where do you want to go?</q></p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox center">
            <p>~~~</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Bree must have been to her favorite Japanese restaurant for dozens of lunches and dinners with various combinations of friends, but she had never yet had an excuse to try their breakfasts. There seemed no time like the present, and she did not regret her decision. They sat in a secluded booth, a lamp hanging above them on a chain, and the waiter was so pleased to see Bree there again that he quite forgot to fuss over Gavriel and his refusal to eat anything. He returned with a tray of hot soup, white rice, grilled fish, and various other, more mysterious entities. Bree had hardly let the steam enter her nostrils before she decided she had to try this with Delphine at some point.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p>Gavriel examined a list of sake brands while Bree experimented with soy beans and seaweed. Everything was delicious. Gavriel laid down the list as Bree stirred mildly with her chopsticks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <p><q>How is it?</q> he asked.</p>
